   ```

3. **Verify Resource Cleanup**:

   ```bash
   # Verify resource group deletion
   az group exists --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
   
   # Should return 'false' when cleanup is complete
   echo "Resource cleanup verification complete"
   ```

## Discussion

Azure Dataverse combined with Azure AI Document Intelligence creates a powerful enterprise document processing platform that addresses the critical challenge of manual data entry and validation using Microsoft's latest AI capabilities. This architecture leverages Microsoft's low-code/no-code Power Platform capabilities while maintaining enterprise-grade security, compliance, and scalability requirements. The integration between these services enables organizations to automate document workflows while preserving human oversight for critical business decisions.

The solution demonstrates how modern cloud platforms can transform traditional document processing through AI-powered extraction using Document Intelligence v4.0, automated validation through Dataverse business rules, and user-friendly interfaces through Power Apps. Azure AI Document Intelligence provides industry-leading accuracy for document understanding with the latest 2024-11-30 API, while Dataverse ensures data integrity and business rule enforcement. Logic Apps orchestrates the entire workflow, providing reliable automation with built-in error handling and monitoring capabilities.

From an enterprise architecture perspective, this solution follows Microsoft's Power Platform best practices for citizen developer empowerment while maintaining IT governance and security standards aligned with the Azure Well-Architected Framework. The separation of concerns between document processing (Azure AI), workflow orchestration (Logic Apps), data storage (Dataverse), and user interfaces (Power Apps) creates a maintainable and scalable system that can evolve with business requirements while following Zero Trust security principles.

> **Tip**: Implement gradual rollout strategies by starting with specific document types and expanding coverage based on processing accuracy and user feedback. Use Dataverse's built-in audit capabilities and Azure Monitor to track processing improvements over time and optimize performance based on actual usage patterns.
