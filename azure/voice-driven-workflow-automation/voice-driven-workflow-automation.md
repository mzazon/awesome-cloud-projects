# Voice-Driven Workflow Automation with Speech Recognition

## Problem

Organizations struggle with time-consuming manual approval processes and data entry tasks that require employees to navigate complex forms and interfaces. Traditional business process automation requires users to interact with multiple systems through clicks, typing, and navigation, creating friction that slows down decision-making and reduces productivity. Companies need a more natural, efficient way to interact with their business systems through voice commands while maintaining security and audit compliance.

## Solution

Build an intelligent voice-driven business process automation system that leverages Azure AI Speech Services to convert spoken commands into structured data, which then triggers automated workflows in Power Platform. This solution uses Azure Logic Apps to orchestrate the integration between speech recognition and Power Automate flows, enabling employees to initiate approvals, update records, and execute business processes through natural voice interactions while maintaining proper audit trails and security controls.

       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --kind SpeechServices \
       --sku S0 \
       --yes
   
   # Get Speech Service keys and endpoint
   SPEECH_KEY=$(az cognitiveservices account keys list \
       --name ${SPEECH_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query key1 --output tsv)
   
   SPEECH_ENDPOINT=$(az cognitiveservices account show \
       --name ${SPEECH_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query properties.endpoint --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Speech Service created with endpoint: ${SPEECH_ENDPOINT}"
   ```

   The Speech Service is now ready to process voice commands with enterprise-grade security and scalability. This foundation enables real-time speech-to-text conversion with customizable models and language support, providing the core capability for voice-driven business process automation.

       --query '[0].properties.callbackUrl' --output tsv)
   
   # Test approve request command
   curl -X POST "${LOGIC_APP_TRIGGER_URL}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "text": "approve request 12345",
         "confidence": 0.95,
         "userId": "test.user@company.com"
       }'
   
   # Test reject request command
   curl -X POST "${LOGIC_APP_TRIGGER_URL}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "text": "reject request 12346",
         "confidence": 0.92,
         "userId": "test.user@company.com"
       }'
   
   echo "✅ Voice command tests completed"
   echo "Check Power Platform for processed requests"
   ```

   The testing validates the complete integration from voice recognition through business process execution, ensuring the system correctly processes commands and maintains audit trails for compliance and monitoring purposes.

## Validation & Testing

1. **Verify Azure Speech Service Configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Test Speech Service availability
   az cognitiveservices account show \
       --name ${SPEECH_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query '{name:name,state:properties.provisioningState,endpoint:properties.endpoint}' \
       --output table
   
   # Test Speech Service connectivity (requires audio file)
   echo "To test speech recognition, use the Speech CLI:"
   echo "spx recognize --microphone --source en-US"
   ```

   Expected output: Speech Service should show as "Succeeded" in provisioning state.

2. **Test Logic App Workflow Execution**:

   ```bash
   # Check Logic App run history
   az logic workflow run list \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query '[0].{status:status,startTime:startTime,endTime:endTime}' \
       --output table
   
   # Test webhook endpoint
   curl -X POST "${LOGIC_APP_TRIGGER_URL}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"text": "approve request 999", "confidence": 0.98, "userId": "test@company.com"}'
   ```

   Expected output: Logic App should process the request and return success status.

3. **Verify Power Platform Integration**:

   ```bash
   # Query Dataverse records through Power Platform CLI
   # (Requires authentication to Power Platform environment)
   echo "Use Power Platform CLI to verify data:"
   echo "pac data list-records --table-name voice_automation_approvals"
   ```

   Expected output: Records should show processed voice commands with proper status updates.

## Cleanup

1. **Remove Azure AI Speech Service**:

   ```bash
   # Delete Speech Service
   az cognitiveservices account delete \
       --name ${SPEECH_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
   
   echo "✅ Speech Service deleted"
   ```

2. **Remove Logic App and Storage**:

   ```bash
   # Delete Logic App
   az logic workflow delete \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
   
   # Delete Storage Account
   az storage account delete \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --yes
   
   echo "✅ Logic App and Storage deleted"
   ```

3. **Remove Resource Group**:

   ```bash
   # Delete entire resource group
   az group delete \
       --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --yes \
       --no-wait
   
   echo "✅ Resource group deletion initiated"
   echo "Note: Power Platform resources require manual cleanup"
   ```

## Discussion

Voice-enabled business process automation represents a significant advancement in human-computer interaction for enterprise applications. Azure AI Speech Services provides enterprise-grade speech recognition with industry-leading accuracy and language support, while Power Platform offers comprehensive low-code automation capabilities.
