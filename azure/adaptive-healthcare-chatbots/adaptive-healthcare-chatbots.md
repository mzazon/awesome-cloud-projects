   ```bash
   # Test SQL Managed Instance connectivity
   az sql mi show \
       --name ${SQL_MI_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query '{name:name, status:state, endpoint:fullyQualifiedDomainName}'
   
   # Verify database schema (when MI deployment completes)
   sqlcmd -S ${SQL_MI_NAME}.database.windows.net \
       -d HealthBotDB -U sqladmin -P "ComplexP@ssw0rd123!" \
       -Q "SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'"
   ```

   Expected output: SQL Managed Instance should show "Ready" state and database tables should be listed.

4. **Test End-to-End Integration**:

   ```bash
   # Test Function App integration
   curl -X POST \
       "https://${FUNCTION_APP_NAME}.azurewebsites.net/api/GetPersonalizedContent" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
           "age": 45,
           "location": "suburban",
           "previousInteractions": ["symptom-checker", "appointment-scheduling"]
       }'
   
   # Verify API Management gateway
   curl -X GET \
       "https://${APIM_NAME}.azure-api.net/health" \
       -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: your-api-key"
   ```

   Expected output: Functions should return personalized content recommendations and API Management should respond with health status.
