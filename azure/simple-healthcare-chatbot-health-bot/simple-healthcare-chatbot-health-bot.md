       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku F0 \
       --tags environment=demo purpose=healthcare-chatbot
   
   echo "✅ Health Bot instance created: ${HEALTH_BOT_NAME}"
   ```

   The Health Bot instance is now provisioned with built-in medical databases, including symptom checkers, disease information, and medication guidance. This foundational service provides the core AI capabilities needed for healthcare conversations while maintaining strict security and compliance standards.

2. **Configure Health Bot Management Portal Access**:

   The Health Bot Management Portal provides a comprehensive interface for configuring scenarios, managing channels, and monitoring conversations. This web-based portal enables healthcare IT teams to customize the bot's behavior without requiring extensive programming knowledge, making it accessible to medical professionals and administrators.

   ```bash
   # Get Health Bot management URL
   MANAGEMENT_URL=$(az healthbot show \
       --name ${HEALTH_BOT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query "properties.botManagementPortalLink" \
       --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Management Portal URL: ${MANAGEMENT_URL}"
   echo "Access this URL to configure your Health Bot scenarios"
   ```

   The management portal provides access to scenario templates, conversation flows, and built-in healthcare intelligence. Healthcare organizations can use these tools to create customized patient interactions while leveraging pre-built medical knowledge and compliance frameworks.

3. **Enable Built-in Healthcare Scenarios**:

   Azure Health Bot includes pre-configured healthcare scenarios such as symptom assessment, medication information, and health condition lookup. These scenarios are built using evidence-based medical protocols and can be activated immediately without custom development, providing instant value for healthcare organizations.

   ```bash
   # Get Health Bot resource details
   az healthbot show \
       --name ${HEALTH_BOT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query "properties" \
       --output table
   
   echo "✅ Health Bot configured with built-in scenarios:"
   echo "- Symptom checker and triage"
   echo "- Disease information lookup"
   echo "- Medication guidance"
   echo "- Doctor type recommendations"
   ```

   These built-in scenarios leverage Microsoft's healthcare intelligence and are regularly updated with the latest medical knowledge. The scenarios follow clinical best practices and include appropriate disclaimers to ensure users understand the limitations of automated medical guidance.

4. **Configure Web Chat Channel**:

   The web chat channel provides a secure, embeddable interface that healthcare organizations can integrate into their websites or patient portals. This channel supports modern web standards and maintains HIPAA compliance through encrypted communications and secure session management.

   ```bash
   # Configure web chat channel (done through portal)
   echo "✅ Web chat channel configuration steps:"
   echo "1. Access the Management Portal: ${MANAGEMENT_URL}"
   echo "2. Navigate to Integration > Channels"
   echo "3. Enable Web Chat channel"
   echo "4. Configure channel settings for your organization"
   echo "5. Copy the embed code for your website"
   ```

   The web chat channel automatically includes necessary security features such as conversation encryption, session timeout, and audit logging. These features ensure patient conversations remain private and meet healthcare compliance requirements.

5. **Test Healthcare Bot Functionality**:

   Testing the Health Bot involves validating both its medical knowledge capabilities and compliance features. The bot should respond appropriately to medical inquiries while maintaining proper disclaimers and directing users to appropriate care when necessary.

   ```bash
   # Access the Health Bot test interface
   echo "✅ Test your Health Bot with these sample queries:"
   echo "- 'I have a headache' (symptom triage)"
   echo "- 'What is diabetes?' (disease information)"
   echo "- 'What doctor treats back pain?' (provider guidance)"
   echo "- 'Help' (available commands)"
   echo ""
   echo "Access test interface at: ${MANAGEMENT_URL}"
   echo "Navigate to: Chat > Test in Portal"
   ```

   The Health Bot includes built-in validation to ensure responses meet medical accuracy standards. It automatically provides appropriate disclaimers and encourages users to seek professional medical care when symptoms require immediate attention.

## Validation & Testing

1. **Verify Health Bot Service Deployment**:

   ```bash
   # Check Health Bot service status
   az healthbot show \
       --name ${HEALTH_BOT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query "properties.provisioningState" \
       --output tsv
   ```

   Expected output: `Succeeded`

2. **Test Built-in Medical Scenarios**:

   Access the Management Portal and use the chat interface to test:
   - Symptom checker: "I have chest pain"
   - Disease lookup: "What are symptoms of flu?"
   - Medication query: "Tell me about aspirin"

   Expected behavior: Bot responds with medically accurate information and appropriate disclaimers.

3. **Validate HIPAA Compliance Features**:

   ```bash
   # Verify encryption and compliance settings
   az healthbot show \
       --name ${HEALTH_BOT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query "properties" \
       --output json
   ```

   Verify that audit trails, data retention policies, and encryption are properly configured for healthcare compliance.
