# Create resource group with appropriate tags
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=video-conferencing environment=demo

echo "✅ Resource group created: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"

# Install Communication Services extension if not already installed
az extension add --name communication
echo "✅ Communication Services extension installed"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Azure Container Registry for Application Images**:

   Azure Container Registry provides secure, private container image storage with built-in security scanning and geo-replication capabilities. This managed service eliminates the need for self-hosted registries while providing integration with Azure Web App for Containers for automated deployments.

   ```bash
   # Create container registry for storing application images
   az acr create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name ${CONTAINER_REGISTRY} \
       --sku Basic \
       --admin-enabled true \
       --location ${LOCATION}
   
   # Get registry login server
   ACR_LOGIN_SERVER=$(az acr show \
       --name ${CONTAINER_REGISTRY} \
       --query loginServer --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Container registry created: ${ACR_LOGIN_SERVER}"
   ```

   The Container Registry is now ready to store your application images with admin access enabled for simplified authentication. This foundational component enables automated container deployment workflows and supports the CI/CD pipeline for your video conferencing application.

2. **Create Azure Communication Services Resource**:

   Azure Communication Services provides APIs for voice, video, chat, and SMS capabilities with global reach and enterprise-grade security. The service handles complex real-time media processing, enabling developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management.

   ```bash
   # Create Communication Services resource

       --name ${COMMUNICATION_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location "Global" \
       --data-location "UnitedStates"
   
   # Get connection string for application configuration
   ACS_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az communication list-key \
       --name ${COMMUNICATION_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query primaryConnectionString --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Communication Services resource created: ${COMMUNICATION_SERVICE}"
   ```

   The Communication Services resource provides the foundation for video calling, call recording, and user management features. This service automatically scales to handle varying call volumes and provides global connectivity with low latency.

   Azure Blob Storage provides scalable, cost-effective storage for call recordings with multiple access tiers and lifecycle management. This storage solution ensures recordings are securely stored and easily accessible for playback, compliance, and analytics purposes.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account for call recordings
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2 \
       --access-tier Hot
   
   # Create container for recordings
   az storage container create \
       --name recordings \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --public-access off
   
   # Get storage connection string
   STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query connectionString --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Storage account created: ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}"
   ```

   The storage account provides secure, persistent storage for call recordings with private access controls. This setup ensures recordings are protected while remaining accessible to authorized application components for processing and playback.

4. **Create App Service Plan for Web App**:

   Azure App Service Plans define the computing resources and scaling capabilities for your web applications. Using a Linux-based plan enables container deployment with automatic scaling, built-in security features, and integrated monitoring capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create Linux App Service Plan for containers
   az appservice plan create \
       --name ${APP_SERVICE_PLAN} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --is-linux \
       --sku P1V2 \
       --number-of-workers 1
   
   echo "✅ App Service Plan created: ${APP_SERVICE_PLAN}"
   ```

   The App Service Plan provides the compute foundation for your containerized application with automatic scaling capabilities. This managed service handles infrastructure provisioning, load balancing, and health monitoring for your video conferencing application.

5. **Create Application Insights for Monitoring**:

   Application Insights provides comprehensive application performance monitoring, user analytics, and diagnostic capabilities. This service enables real-time monitoring of video conferencing sessions, performance optimization, and proactive issue detection.

   # Create Application Insights workspace
   az monitor app-insights component create \
       --app video-conferencing-insights \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --application-type web \
       --kind web
   
   # Get instrumentation key
   APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY=$(az monitor app-insights component show \
       --app video-conferencing-insights \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query instrumentationKey --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Application Insights created with key: ${APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY}"
   ```

   Application Insights provides real-time visibility into application performance, user behavior, and system health. This monitoring capability is essential for maintaining high-quality video conferencing experiences and identifying optimization opportunities.

6. **Create Sample Application Container**:

   A containerized Node.js application provides the foundation for integrating Azure Communication Services with your video conferencing interface. This approach enables consistent deployment across environments and simplified scaling management.

   ```bash
   # Create application directory structure
   mkdir -p video-conferencing-app/src
   cd video-conferencing-app

        --name "video-conferencing-autoscale" \
        --min-count 1 \
        --max-count 10 \
        --count 2
    
    # Add CPU-based scaling rule (scale out)
    az monitor autoscale rule create \
        --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
        --autoscale-name "video-conferencing-autoscale" \
        --condition "Percentage CPU > 70 avg 5m" \
        --scale out 1
    
    # Add CPU-based scaling rule (scale in)
    az monitor autoscale rule create \
        --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
        --autoscale-name "video-conferencing-autoscale" \
        --condition "Percentage CPU < 30 avg 5m" \
        --scale in 1

## Challenge

Extend this solution by implementing these enhancements:

1. **Implement advanced call recording features** by adding support for mixed and unmixed recording formats, automatic transcription using Azure Cognitive Services Speech-to-Text, and custom retention policies with Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management.

2. **Add real-time analytics and monitoring** by integrating Azure SignalR Service for live call statistics, implementing custom Application Insights dashboards for call quality metrics, and creating automated alerts for system performance issues.

3. **Enhance security and compliance** by implementing Azure Key Vault for secure credential management, adding Azure AD authentication for user management, and implementing data encryption at rest for stored recordings.

4. **Scale to multi-region deployment** by setting up Azure Front Door for global load balancing, implementing cross-region container registry replication, and configuring geo-redundant storage for high availability.

5. **Integrate with Microsoft Teams** by implementing Teams interoperability features, adding support for Teams calling capabilities, and creating hybrid meeting scenarios that connect internal and external participants.
