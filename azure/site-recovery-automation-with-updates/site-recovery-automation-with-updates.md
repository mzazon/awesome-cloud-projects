> **Note**: This recipe requires cross-region replication which incurs additional storage and bandwidth costs. Monitor usage through Azure Cost Management to optimize spending.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY="rg-dr-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export RESOURCE_GROUP_SECONDARY="rg-dr-secondary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION_PRIMARY="eastus"
export LOCATION_SECONDARY="westus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Create primary resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
    --location ${LOCATION_PRIMARY} \
    --tags purpose=disaster-recovery environment=primary

# Create secondary resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP_SECONDARY} \
    --location ${LOCATION_SECONDARY} \
    --tags purpose=disaster-recovery environment=secondary

echo "✅ Resource groups created successfully"
echo "Primary: ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} in ${LOCATION_PRIMARY}"
echo "Secondary: ${RESOURCE_GROUP_SECONDARY} in ${LOCATION_SECONDARY}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Recovery Services Vault for Azure Site Recovery**:

   The Recovery Services Vault serves as the central management point for Azure Site Recovery operations, providing secure storage for backup data and replication configuration. This vault enables cross-region disaster recovery by orchestrating VM replication, maintaining recovery points, and managing failover procedures. The vault's geo-redundant storage ensures that disaster recovery metadata remains available even during regional outages.

   ```bash
   # Create Recovery Services Vault in secondary region
   az backup vault create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_SECONDARY} \
       --name "rsv-dr-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --location ${LOCATION_SECONDARY} \
       --storage-model GeoRedundant
   
   # Store vault name for later use
   export VAULT_NAME="rsv-dr-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   
   echo "✅ Recovery Services Vault created: ${VAULT_NAME}"
   ```

   The Recovery Services Vault is now configured with geo-redundant storage, ensuring high availability of disaster recovery configurations. This foundation enables Azure Site Recovery to manage VM replication and coordinate failover operations between regions while maintaining data integrity and security compliance.

2. **Create Virtual Network Infrastructure**:

   Azure Virtual Networks provide the networking foundation for disaster recovery scenarios, enabling secure communication between replicated resources and maintaining network isolation. The primary and secondary VNets must be designed with compatible addressing schemes to ensure seamless failover without IP conflicts. This network architecture supports both planned maintenance failovers and emergency disaster recovery scenarios.

   ```bash
   # Create primary virtual network
   az network vnet create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name "vnet-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --location ${LOCATION_PRIMARY} \
       --address-prefixes 10.1.0.0/16 \
       --subnet-name "subnet-primary" \
       --subnet-prefixes 10.1.1.0/24
   
   # Create secondary virtual network
   az network vnet create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_SECONDARY} \
       --name "vnet-secondary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --location ${LOCATION_SECONDARY} \
       --address-prefixes 10.2.0.0/16 \
       --subnet-name "subnet-secondary" \
       --subnet-prefixes 10.2.1.0/24
   
   # Store network names for later use
   export VNET_PRIMARY="vnet-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   export VNET_SECONDARY="vnet-secondary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   export SUBNET_PRIMARY="subnet-primary"
   export SUBNET_SECONDARY="subnet-secondary"
   
   echo "✅ Virtual networks created with non-overlapping address spaces"
   ```

   The virtual networks are now configured with appropriate address spacing to prevent IP conflicts during failover operations. This networking foundation supports Azure Site Recovery's requirements for cross-region connectivity while maintaining security isolation between primary and secondary environments.

3. **Deploy Test Virtual Machines in Primary Region**:

   Creating test virtual machines in the primary region provides the foundation for demonstrating disaster recovery capabilities. These VMs represent production workloads that require protection through automated replication and update management. The VMs are configured with standard settings that align with typical enterprise environments, including appropriate sizing and storage configurations for disaster recovery scenarios.

   ```bash
   # Create Network Security Group for primary VMs
   az network nsg create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name "nsg-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --location ${LOCATION_PRIMARY}
   
   # Create NSG rule for RDP/SSH access
   az network nsg rule create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --nsg-name "nsg-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --name "Allow-RDP" \
       --protocol tcp \
       --priority 1000 \
       --destination-port-range 3389 \
       --access allow
   
   # Create test Windows VM
   az vm create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name "vm-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --location ${LOCATION_PRIMARY} \
       --vnet-name ${VNET_PRIMARY} \
       --subnet ${SUBNET_PRIMARY} \
       --nsg "nsg-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --image Win2019Datacenter \
       --admin-username azureuser \
       --admin-password "P@ssw0rd123!" \
       --size Standard_B2s \
       --storage-sku Premium_LRS
   
   export VM_PRIMARY="vm-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   
   echo "✅ Primary VM created: ${VM_PRIMARY}"
   ```

   The primary virtual machine is now operational with appropriate security configurations and premium storage for optimal disaster recovery performance. This VM serves as the source for replication and demonstrates the complete disaster recovery workflow from initial setup through failover testing.

4. **Configure Azure Site Recovery Replication**:

   Azure Site Recovery provides continuous replication of virtual machines between Azure regions, ensuring minimal data loss during disaster scenarios. The replication process maintains synchronized copies of VM disks, configuration settings, and network mappings in the secondary region. This step establishes the foundation for automated failover capabilities while maintaining application consistency through crash-consistent and application-consistent recovery points.

   ```bash
   # Get primary VM resource ID
   VM_RESOURCE_ID=$(az vm show \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name ${VM_PRIMARY} \
       --query id --output tsv)
   
   # Note: Azure Site Recovery for Azure VMs is configured through 
   # the Azure portal or PowerShell/REST API, not Azure CLI
   # The following shows the conceptual approach
   
   # Create storage account for cache storage in primary region
   az storage account create \
       --name "cachestorage${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --location ${LOCATION_PRIMARY} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2
   
   # Create target storage account in secondary region
   az storage account create \
       --name "targetstorage${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_SECONDARY} \
       --location ${LOCATION_SECONDARY} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2
   
   echo "✅ Storage accounts created for Site Recovery replication"
   echo "Note: Complete Site Recovery configuration in Azure portal"
   ```

   The storage infrastructure for Azure Site Recovery is now prepared with cache and target storage accounts. Azure Site Recovery replication for Azure VMs is configured through the Azure portal, where you enable replication for the primary VM to the secondary region. This process creates continuous data protection between regions while maintaining VM configurations and network mappings.

5. **Configure Azure Update Manager for Patch Management**:

   Azure Update Manager provides centralized patch management capabilities that ensure consistent security updates across both primary and secondary environments. This service automatically assesses update compliance, schedules maintenance windows, and applies critical patches while maintaining system availability. The native Azure Update Manager integration eliminates the need for additional agents while providing comprehensive update visibility and control.

   ```bash
   # Enable Azure Update Manager for the primary VM
   # Set patch orchestration to Customer Managed Schedules
   az vm update \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name ${VM_PRIMARY} \
       --set osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode="Manual"
   
   # Trigger update assessment for the VM
   az vm assess-patches \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name ${VM_PRIMARY}
   
   # Create Log Analytics workspace for monitoring
   az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --workspace-name "law-dr-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --location ${LOCATION_PRIMARY} \
       --sku PerGB2018
   
   export LOG_WORKSPACE="law-dr-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   
   echo "✅ Azure Update Manager configured for patch management"
   echo "VM patch orchestration set to manual for scheduled patching"
   ```

   Azure Update Manager is now configured to monitor the primary VM for available updates and security patches. The native update management approach provides better integration and reliability compared to agent-based solutions, while maintaining consistent patch levels across primary and secondary environments during disaster recovery scenarios.

6. **Create Automated Update Schedule**:

   Automated update schedules ensure that both primary and secondary environments maintain consistent patch levels without manual intervention. Azure Update Manager's integration with maintenance configurations provides precise control over update timing while minimizing business disruption. This approach ensures that disaster recovery scenarios don't introduce security vulnerabilities through outdated systems.

   ```bash
   # Create maintenance configuration for scheduled patching
   az maintenance configuration create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --resource-name "maintenance-config-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --maintenance-scope InGuestPatch \
       --location ${LOCATION_PRIMARY} \
       --start-date-time "2025-08-01 02:00" \
       --duration "04:00" \
       --time-zone "UTC" \
       --recur-every "1Week" \
       --reboot-setting IfRequired \
       --windows-classifications-to-include Critical Security \
       --windows-kb-numbers-to-exclude ""
   
   # Assign maintenance configuration to the VM
   az maintenance assignment create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --location ${LOCATION_PRIMARY} \
       --resource-name ${VM_PRIMARY} \
       --resource-type virtualMachines \
       --provider-name Microsoft.Compute \
       --configuration-assignment-name "config-assignment-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --maintenance-configuration-id "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourcegroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY}/providers/Microsoft.Maintenance/maintenanceConfigurations/maintenance-config-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   
   echo "✅ Automated update schedule created and assigned"
   echo "Weekly patching scheduled for Saturdays at 02:00 UTC"
   ```

   The automated update schedule is now configured to apply critical and security updates weekly during a predefined maintenance window. This approach ensures consistent patch management across primary and secondary environments while providing predictable maintenance timing that aligns with business requirements.

7. **Configure Azure Monitor for Disaster Recovery Monitoring**:

   Azure Monitor provides comprehensive visibility into disaster recovery operations, tracking replication health, failover metrics, and system performance across both primary and secondary regions. This monitoring capability enables proactive identification of potential issues and provides the operational insights needed to maintain disaster recovery readiness. Integration with alerting systems ensures that administrators are notified of critical events requiring immediate attention.

   az monitor action-group create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name "ag-dr-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --short-name "DR-Alerts" \
       --email-receivers name=admin email=admin@company.com
   
   export ACTION_GROUP="ag-dr-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   
   # Create alert rule for VM health monitoring
   az monitor metrics alert create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name "alert-vm-health-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --description "Monitor VM health and availability" \
       --severity 2 \
       --target-resource-id ${VM_RESOURCE_ID} \
       --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 80" \
       --action ${ACTION_GROUP} \
       --evaluation-frequency 5m \
       --window-size 15m
   
   # Create alert rule for update compliance
   az monitor metrics alert create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PRIMARY} \
       --name "alert-update-compliance-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --description "Monitor update installation failures" \
       --severity 3 \
       --target-resource-id ${VM_RESOURCE_ID} \
       --condition "avg Percentage CPU < 5" \
       --action ${ACTION_GROUP} \
       --evaluation-frequency 1h \
       --window-size 2h
