   # Get OpenAI service endpoint and key
   export OPENAI_ENDPOINT=$(az cognitiveservices account show \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query properties.endpoint --output tsv)
   
   export OPENAI_KEY=$(az cognitiveservices account keys list \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query key1 --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Azure OpenAI service created with endpoint: ${OPENAI_ENDPOINT}"
   ```

   The OpenAI service is now ready to generate personalized email content. The service provides enterprise security features including data encryption, private networking, and content filtering to ensure responsible AI usage in marketing campaigns.

2. **Deploy GPT-4o Model for Content Generation**:

   GPT-4o integrates text and images in a single model, enabling it to handle multiple data types simultaneously. This multimodal approach enhances accuracy and responsiveness in human-computer interactions while matching GPT-4 Turbo performance in English text and coding tasks with superior performance in non-English languages.

   ```bash
   # Deploy GPT-4o model for content generation
   az cognitiveservices account deployment create \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --deployment-name gpt-4o-marketing \
       --model-name gpt-4o \
       --model-version "2024-11-20" \
       --model-format OpenAI \
       --sku-capacity 10 \
       --sku-name "Standard"
   
   echo "✅ GPT-4o model deployed for marketing content generation"
   ```

   The GPT-4o deployment provides enhanced creative writing abilities and structured output capabilities, making it ideal for generating personalized marketing content with consistent formatting and brand voice alignment.

3. **Create Azure Communication Services for Email Delivery**:

   Azure Communication Services provides enterprise-grade email delivery with high deliverability rates, detailed analytics, and compliance features. The service handles email infrastructure complexity while providing APIs for programmatic email sending and delivery tracking.

   ```bash
   # Create Communication Services resource
   az communication create \
       --name ${COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location "Global"
   
   # Create Email Communication Services resource
   az communication email create \
       --name ${EMAIL_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location "Global" \
       --data-location "United States"
   
   # Get connection string for Communication Services
   export COMMUNICATION_STRING=$(az communication list-key \
       --name ${COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query primaryConnectionString --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Communication Services created for email delivery"
   ```

   The Communication Services resource now provides scalable email delivery capabilities with built-in compliance features and detailed delivery analytics for campaign performance tracking.

4. **Configure Email Domain and Sender Address**:

   Azure Managed Domains provide a quick setup option for email delivery without requiring domain verification. This approach is ideal for development and testing environments where custom branding is less critical than rapid deployment.

   ```bash
   # Add AzureManagedDomain to Email Communication Service
   az communication email domain create \
       --domain-name "AzureManagedDomain" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --email-service-name ${EMAIL_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --domain-management "AzureManaged"
   
   # Get the sender email address
   export SENDER_EMAIL="DoNotReply@$(az communication email domain show \
       --domain-name "AzureManagedDomain" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --email-service-name ${EMAIL_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --query mailFromSenderDomain --output tsv)"
   
   # Connect Communication Services with Email Service
   az communication email domain connect \
       --domain-name "AzureManagedDomain" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --email-service-name ${EMAIL_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --communication-service-name ${COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Email domain configured with sender: ${SENDER_EMAIL}"
   ```

   The email domain configuration establishes the sender identity for marketing campaigns. Azure Managed Domains automatically handle DNS configuration and reputation management for reliable email delivery.

5. **Create Storage Account for Workflow State**:

   Azure Storage provides the persistence layer for Logic Apps Standard, storing workflow state, run history, and configuration data. The Standard tier requires dedicated storage for enhanced performance and local development capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account for Logic Apps runtime
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2
   
   # Get storage connection string
   export STORAGE_CONNECTION=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query connectionString --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Storage account created for workflow state management"
   ```

   The storage account enables Logic Apps to maintain workflow state across executions and provides the foundation for debugging and monitoring workflow performance.

6. **Create Logic Apps Standard Resource**:

   Azure Logic Apps Standard provides serverless workflow orchestration with built-in AI agent capabilities for integrating with Azure OpenAI. The Standard tier offers local state management, higher performance, and integrated development experience for complex AI-powered workflows.

   ```bash
   # Create Logic Apps Standard resource

       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --storage-account ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --consumption-plan-location ${LOCATION} \
       --runtime node \
       --functions-version 4 \
       --os-type Linux
   
   # Configure Logic App settings for AI integration
   az functionapp config appsettings set \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --settings \
           "OPENAI_ENDPOINT=${OPENAI_ENDPOINT}" \
           "OPENAI_KEY=${OPENAI_KEY}" \
           "COMMUNICATION_STRING=${COMMUNICATION_STRING}" \
           "SENDER_EMAIL=${SENDER_EMAIL}"
   
   echo "✅ Logic Apps Standard resource created and configured"
   ```

   The Logic Apps resource is now configured with AI capabilities and can orchestrate complex email marketing workflows with automatic scaling and built-in monitoring.

7. **Create AI Agent Workflow Definition**:

   Logic Apps workflows are defined using JSON schemas that describe triggers, actions, and data flow. This workflow definition integrates Azure OpenAI for content generation with Communication Services for email delivery, creating an end-to-end marketing automation pipeline.

   ```bash
   # Create workflow definition for AI-powered email marketing
