# SMS Compliance Automation with Communication Services

## Problem

Organizations sending SMS marketing campaigns face significant compliance challenges with ever-changing regulations like TCPA, CAN-SPAM, and GDPR that require proper opt-out management. Manual handling of opt-out requests across multiple channels (SMS, email, web portals) creates compliance gaps, potential regulatory violations, and customer dissatisfaction due to delayed or missed opt-out processing.

## Solution

Implement automated SMS compliance management using Azure Communication Services' new Opt-Out Management API with serverless Azure Functions to create real-time, multi-channel opt-out workflows. This solution automatically processes opt-out requests, synchronizes preferences across channels, and maintains centralized compliance records while ensuring regulatory adherence through intelligent automation.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure subscription with Communication Services and Functions permissions
2. Azure CLI installed and configured (or Azure Cloud Shell)
3. Basic understanding of SMS compliance regulations (TCPA/CAN-SPAM)
4. SMS-enabled phone number from Azure Communication Services
5. Estimated cost: $5-10 per month for development/testing workloads

> **Note**: This recipe uses Azure Communication Services SMS Opt-Out Management API currently in Public Preview, introduced in January 2025.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-sms-compliance-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Communication Services and Functions resource names
export COMMUNICATION_SERVICE="sms-comm-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export FUNCTION_APP="sms-compliance-func-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT="smsstorage${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=recipe environment=demo

echo "✅ Resource group created: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Azure Communication Services Resource**:

   Azure Communication Services provides enterprise-grade SMS capabilities with built-in compliance features. The new Opt-Out Management API (Public Preview) enables programmatic control over SMS opt-out preferences, allowing businesses to automate compliance workflows and maintain centralized opt-out databases across multiple communication channels.

   ```bash
   # Create Communication Services resource
   az communication create \
       --name ${COMMUNICATION_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location "global" \
       --data-location "United States"
   
   # Get connection string for the Communication Services resource
   COMM_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az communication list-key \
       --name ${COMMUNICATION_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query primaryConnectionString \
       --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Communication Services resource created with opt-out API access"
   ```

   The Communication Services resource now provides access to the SMS Opt-Out Management API, enabling automated opt-out handling with endpoints for adding, removing, and checking opt-out entries programmatically.

2. **Create Storage Account for Function App**:

   Azure Storage provides the underlying infrastructure for Azure Functions runtime and enables persistent storage for compliance audit logs. Creating a storage account with appropriate redundancy ensures function reliability and maintains compliance records for regulatory auditing requirements.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account for Function App
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2
   
   # Create table for storing opt-out audit logs
   az storage table create \
       --name "optoutaudit" \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --auth-mode login
   
   echo "✅ Storage account created with audit table"
   ```

   The storage account provides both Function App hosting requirements and compliance audit storage through Azure Table Storage, ensuring all opt-out events are logged for regulatory compliance.

3. **Create Function App with System Identity**:

   Azure Functions provides serverless compute for automated SMS compliance processing. The consumption plan offers cost-effective scaling based on demand, while managed identity integration ensures secure access to Communication Services without storing connection strings in code.

   ```bash
   # Create Function App with consumption plan
   az functionapp create \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --storage-account ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --consumption-plan-location ${LOCATION} \
       --runtime node \
       --runtime-version 20 \
       --functions-version 4 \
       --assign-identity
   
   # Configure Communication Services connection string
   az functionapp config appsettings set \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --settings "CommunicationServicesConnectionString=${COMM_CONNECTION_STRING}"
   
   echo "✅ Function App created with managed identity"
   ```

   The Function App is configured with managed identity for secure access to Azure services and includes the Communication Services connection string for SMS opt-out API operations.

4. **Deploy HTTP Trigger Function for Opt-out Processing**:

   HTTP-triggered functions provide webhook endpoints for receiving opt-out requests from multiple channels. This function processes incoming opt-out requests, validates phone numbers, calls the Communication Services Opt-Out Management API, and logs compliance events for audit purposes.

   ```bash
   # Create temporary directory for function code
   mkdir -p ./sms-compliance-functions/OptOutProcessor
   
   # Create function.json configuration
   cat > ./sms-compliance-functions/OptOutProcessor/function.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "bindings": [
       {
         "authLevel": "function",
         "type": "httpTrigger",
         "direction": "in",
         "name": "req",
         "methods": ["post"]
       },
       {
         "type": "http",
         "direction": "out",
         "name": "res"
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Function configuration created"
   ```

   The HTTP trigger configuration enables secure webhook processing with function-level authentication, ensuring only authorized systems can submit opt-out requests to the compliance automation system.

5. **Create Opt-out Processing Logic**:

   The core processing logic handles opt-out requests by validating input data, calling the Communication Services Opt-Out Management API, and maintaining audit logs. This implementation follows SMS compliance best practices by immediately processing opt-out requests and providing confirmation responses.

   ```bash
   # Create main function code for opt-out processing
   cat > ./sms-compliance-functions/OptOutProcessor/index.js << 'EOF'
   const { SmsClient } = require('@azure/communication-sms');
   const { TableClient } = require('@azure/data-tables');

   module.exports = async function (context, req) {
       context.log('SMS Compliance opt-out request received');
       
       try {
           // Validate required parameters
           const { phoneNumber, fromNumber, channel = 'sms' } = req.body;
           
           if (!phoneNumber || !fromNumber) {
               context.res = {
                   status: 400,
                   body: { error: 'phoneNumber and fromNumber are required' }
               };
               return;
           }
           
           // Initialize Communication Services client
           const connectionString = process.env.CommunicationServicesConnectionString;
           const smsClient = new SmsClient(connectionString);
           
           // Add phone number to opt-out list using new API
           const optOutResult = await smsClient.optOuts.add(fromNumber, [phoneNumber]);
           
           // Log compliance event for audit
           const auditRecord = {
               partitionKey: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
               rowKey: `${phoneNumber}-${Date.now()}`,
               phoneNumber: phoneNumber,
               fromNumber: fromNumber,
               channel: channel,
               action: 'opt-out',
               timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
               status: optOutResult.value[0].httpStatusCode === 200 ? 'success' : 'failed'
           };
           
           // Store audit record (simplified for demo)
           context.log('Audit record:', auditRecord);
           
           // Return success response
           context.res = {
               status: 200,
               body: {
                   message: 'Opt-out processed successfully',
                   phoneNumber: phoneNumber,
                   status: 'opted-out',
                   timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
               }
           };
           
       } catch (error) {
           context.log.error('Error processing opt-out:', error);
           context.res = {
               status: 500,
               body: { error: 'Failed to process opt-out request' }
           };
       }
   };
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Opt-out processing logic created"
   ```

   This function implements the core compliance workflow by leveraging the new Azure Communication Services Opt-Out Management API to immediately add phone numbers to the opt-out database and maintain detailed audit logs.

6. **Create Timer Function for Compliance Monitoring**:

   A timer-triggered function provides automated compliance monitoring by periodically checking opt-out status, generating compliance reports, and ensuring data consistency. This proactive approach helps maintain regulatory compliance and provides early warning of potential issues.

   ```bash
   # Create compliance monitoring function
   mkdir -p ./sms-compliance-functions/ComplianceMonitor
   
   # Create timer trigger configuration (runs daily at 9 AM UTC)
   cat > ./sms-compliance-functions/ComplianceMonitor/function.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "bindings": [
       {
         "name": "myTimer",
         "type": "timerTrigger",
         "direction": "in",
         "schedule": "0 0 9 * * *"
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF
   
   # Create monitoring logic
   cat > ./sms-compliance-functions/ComplianceMonitor/index.js << 'EOF'
   const { SmsClient } = require('@azure/communication-sms');

   module.exports = async function (context, myTimer) {
       context.log('Starting compliance monitoring check');
       
       try {
           const connectionString = process.env.CommunicationServicesConnectionString;
           const smsClient = new SmsClient(connectionString);
           
           // Example: Check opt-out status for monitoring
           // In production, this would check against your customer database
           const sampleNumbers = ['+1234567890', '+1987654321']; // Example numbers
           
           for (const number of sampleNumbers) {
               try {
                   const checkResult = await smsClient.optOuts.check('+18005551234', [number]);
                   context.log(`Opt-out status for ${number}:`, checkResult.value[0].isOptedOut);
               } catch (error) {
                   context.log.error(`Error checking ${number}:`, error.message);
               }
           }
           
           context.log('Compliance monitoring completed successfully');
           
       } catch (error) {
           context.log.error('Compliance monitoring failed:', error);
       }
   };
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Compliance monitoring function created"
   ```

   The timer function runs daily compliance checks, ensuring opt-out preferences are properly maintained and providing automated monitoring of the compliance system's health and effectiveness.

7. **Deploy Functions and Configure Dependencies**:

   Deploying the functions with proper dependency management ensures reliable operation of the compliance automation system. The Azure Communication Services SDK provides the necessary tools for interacting with the Opt-Out Management API and maintaining compliance workflows.

   ```bash
   # Create package.json for dependencies
   cat > ./sms-compliance-functions/package.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "name": "sms-compliance-functions",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "SMS compliance automation functions",
     "dependencies": {
