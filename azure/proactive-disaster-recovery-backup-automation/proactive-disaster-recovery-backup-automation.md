# Proactive Disaster Recovery with Backup Center Automation

## Problem

Organizations face significant challenges in maintaining business continuity during regional outages or catastrophic failures. Traditional disaster recovery approaches often rely on manual processes, lack comprehensive monitoring, and cannot automatically detect and respond to failures across multiple Azure resources. Without intelligent orchestration, recovery procedures become time-consuming, error-prone, and fail to meet critical Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) required for business-critical applications.

## Solution

This solution implements an intelligent disaster recovery orchestration system using Azure Backup Center for centralized backup management, Azure Recovery Services Vault for secure data protection, Azure Monitor for comprehensive failure detection, and Azure Logic Apps for automated recovery workflows. The architecture provides proactive monitoring, automated failover detection, cross-region backup restoration, and intelligent alerting to ensure minimal downtime and data loss during disaster scenarios.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export PRIMARY_REGION="eastus"
export SECONDARY_REGION="westus2"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-dr-orchestration-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BACKUP_RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-dr-backup-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
echo "Using random suffix: ${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Set resource names with proper Azure naming conventions
export RSV_PRIMARY_NAME="rsv-dr-primary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export RSV_SECONDARY_NAME="rsv-dr-secondary-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="stdrbackup${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOGIC_APP_NAME="la-dr-orchestration-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export MONITOR_WORKSPACE_NAME="law-dr-monitoring-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export ACTION_GROUP_NAME="ag-dr-alerts-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create primary resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${PRIMARY_REGION} \
    --tags purpose=disaster-recovery environment=production

# Create backup resource group
az group create \
    --name ${BACKUP_RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${PRIMARY_REGION} \
    --tags purpose=backup environment=production

echo "✅ Resource groups created successfully"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Recovery Services Vaults for Multi-Region Protection**:

   Recovery Services Vaults provide secure, scalable backup storage with built-in encryption and compliance features. Creating vaults in both primary and secondary regions enables cross-region disaster recovery capabilities with automated replication and geo-redundant storage. This dual-vault architecture ensures backup availability even during complete regional failures and supports Azure's recommended disaster recovery patterns.

   ```bash
   # Create primary Recovery Services Vault
   az backup vault create \
       --name ${RSV_PRIMARY_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${BACKUP_RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --tags environment=production purpose=backup region=primary
   
   # Create secondary Recovery Services Vault
   az backup vault create \
       --name ${RSV_SECONDARY_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${BACKUP_RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${SECONDARY_REGION} \
       --tags environment=production purpose=backup region=secondary
   
   echo "✅ Recovery Services Vaults created in both regions"
   ```

   The Recovery Services Vaults are now configured with the default geo-redundant storage, ensuring backup data is replicated across Azure regions automatically. This foundational infrastructure provides the secure, compliant storage layer required for enterprise disaster recovery operations while enabling centralized management through Azure Backup Center.

2. **Set Up Log Analytics Workspace for Comprehensive Monitoring**:

   Log Analytics Workspace serves as the central repository for all monitoring data, enabling advanced querying, alerting, and visualization across your disaster recovery infrastructure. This workspace aggregates backup job logs, resource health metrics, and application performance data, providing the intelligence needed for proactive failure detection and automated recovery orchestration.

   ```bash
   # Create Log Analytics Workspace
   az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
       --workspace-name ${MONITOR_WORKSPACE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --sku PerGB2018 \
       --tags purpose=monitoring environment=production
   
   # Get workspace ID for later configuration
   WORKSPACE_ID=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
       --name ${MONITOR_WORKSPACE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query customerId --output tsv)
   
   # Enable diagnostic settings for Recovery Services Vaults
   az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
       --name "DiagnosticSettings-${RSV_PRIMARY_NAME}" \
       --resource "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${BACKUP_RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/${RSV_PRIMARY_NAME}" \
       --workspace ${WORKSPACE_ID} \
       --logs '[
           {"category":"AddonAzureBackupJobs","enabled":true},
           {"category":"AddonAzureBackupAlerts","enabled":true},
           {"category":"AzureBackupReport","enabled":true}
       ]' \
       --metrics '[{"category":"Health","enabled":true}]'
   
   echo "✅ Log Analytics Workspace configured with diagnostic settings"
   ```

   The monitoring infrastructure now captures comprehensive backup and recovery metrics, enabling intelligent alerting and automated decision-making. This centralized logging approach provides visibility into backup success rates, storage consumption, and resource health across both regions, forming the foundation for intelligent disaster recovery orchestration.

3. **Create Action Groups for Multi-Channel Alerting**:

   Action Groups define how Azure Monitor alerts are delivered to your operations teams through multiple notification channels. Configuring diverse notification methods ensures critical disaster recovery alerts reach the right people through their preferred communication channels, enabling rapid response to failures and backup issues that require immediate attention.

   ```bash
   # Create Action Group for disaster recovery alerts
   az monitor action-group create \
       --name ${ACTION_GROUP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --short-name "DR-Alerts" \
       --action email admin-email admin@company.com \
       --action sms admin-sms +1234567890 \
       --tags purpose=alerting environment=production
   
   # Store action group resource ID for later use
   ACTION_GROUP_ID=$(az monitor action-group show \
       --name ${ACTION_GROUP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query id --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Action Group created with multi-channel notifications"
   ```

   The Action Group now provides comprehensive notification capabilities for disaster recovery events. This multi-channel approach ensures that critical backup failures, regional outages, and recovery operations trigger immediate notifications through email, SMS, and automated webhook integrations with downstream orchestration systems.

4. **Deploy Logic Apps for Automated Recovery Orchestration**:

   Logic Apps provides the serverless workflow engine that orchestrates intelligent disaster recovery responses. This workflow automation eliminates manual intervention during critical recovery scenarios, reducing recovery time and human error while ensuring consistent execution of complex disaster recovery procedures across multiple Azure services and regions.

   ```bash
   # Create Logic App for disaster recovery orchestration
   az logic workflow create \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --definition '{}' \
       --tags purpose=orchestration environment=production
   
   # Create storage account for Logic Apps state management
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2 \
       --tags purpose=orchestration environment=production
   
   # Get storage account connection string
   STORAGE_CONNECTION=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query connectionString --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Logic Apps infrastructure deployed successfully"
   ```

   The Logic Apps workflow environment is now ready to execute automated disaster recovery procedures. This serverless orchestration platform provides the scalability and reliability needed for complex recovery scenarios while maintaining low operational overhead and cost-effective execution based on actual usage patterns.

5. **Configure Backup Policies for Intelligent Protection**:

   Backup policies define the protection strategy for your Azure resources, including backup frequency, retention periods, and recovery point objectives. Implementing intelligent backup policies ensures optimal protection while managing storage costs and compliance requirements. These policies form the foundation of your disaster recovery strategy by defining how data is captured, stored, and made available for recovery operations.

   ```bash
   # Create backup policy for VMs with intelligent scheduling
   az backup policy create \
       --resource-group ${BACKUP_RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --vault-name ${RSV_PRIMARY_NAME} \
       --name "DRVMPolicy" \
       --backup-management-type AzureIaasVM \
       --policy '{
           "name": "DRVMPolicy",

               "retentionPolicy": {
                   "retentionPolicyType": "LongTermRetentionPolicy",
                   "dailySchedule": {
                       "retentionTimes": ["2024-01-01T02:00:00.000Z"],
                       "retentionDuration": {
                           "count": 30,
                           "durationType": "Days"
                       }
                   },
                   "weeklySchedule": {
                       "daysOfTheWeek": ["Sunday"],
                       "retentionTimes": ["2024-01-01T02:00:00.000Z"],
                       "retentionDuration": {
                           "count": 12,
                           "durationType": "Weeks"
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }'
   
   echo "✅ Intelligent backup policies configured for VMs"
   ```

   The backup policies now provide comprehensive protection with optimized scheduling and retention strategies. These policies ensure consistent data protection while balancing recovery requirements with storage costs, enabling rapid recovery operations during disaster scenarios while maintaining long-term compliance and governance standards.

6. **Set Up Azure Monitor Alert Rules for Proactive Detection**:
