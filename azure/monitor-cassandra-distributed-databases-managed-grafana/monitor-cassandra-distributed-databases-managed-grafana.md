## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-cassandra-monitoring-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME="cassandra-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export GRAFANA_NAME="grafana-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export VNET_NAME="vnet-cassandra-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=recipe environment=demo

echo "✅ Resource group created: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"

# Create virtual network for Cassandra cluster
az network vnet create \
    --name ${VNET_NAME} \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16

# Create subnet for Cassandra nodes
az network vnet subnet create \
    --name cassandra-subnet \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --vnet-name ${VNET_NAME} \
    --address-prefixes 10.0.1.0/24

echo "✅ Virtual network configured: ${VNET_NAME}"
```

## Steps

1. **Deploy Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra**:

   Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra provides a fully managed, enterprise-ready Apache Cassandra service that eliminates the operational overhead of managing distributed NoSQL databases. The service automatically handles node provisioning, patching, and scaling while maintaining high availability across availability zones. This managed approach ensures consistent performance and reliability for mission-critical applications requiring low-latency data access.

   ```bash
   # Create Cassandra cluster
   az managed-cassandra cluster create \
       --cluster-name ${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --delegated-management-subnet-id "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/${VNET_NAME}/subnets/cassandra-subnet" \
       --initial-cassandra-admin-password "P@ssw0rd123!" \
       --client-certificates \
       --cassandra-version "4.0"
   
   echo "✅ Cassandra cluster deployment initiated: ${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME}"
   
   # Wait for cluster creation (this may take 15-20 minutes)
   az managed-cassandra cluster wait \
       --name ${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --created
   
   echo "✅ Cassandra cluster ready"
   ```

   The Cassandra cluster is now deployed with secure default configurations and integrated Azure Monitor metrics collection. This foundational infrastructure provides automatic backup, encryption at rest, and network isolation through the dedicated subnet, ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance.

2. **Create Cassandra Data Center**:

   Data centers in Cassandra represent geographical or logical groupings of nodes that provide data replication and fault tolerance. Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra uses data centers to distribute workloads and ensure high availability. By creating a properly sized data center, you establish the foundation for scalable performance and resilience against node failures.

   ```bash
   # Create data center with 3 nodes
   az managed-cassandra datacenter create \
       --cluster-name ${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --data-center-name "dc1" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --data-center-location ${LOCATION} \
       --delegated-subnet-id "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/${VNET_NAME}/subnets/cassandra-subnet" \
       --node-count 3 \
       --sku "Standard_DS14_v2"
   
   echo "✅ Data center creation initiated with 3 nodes"
   
   # Wait for data center to be ready
   az managed-cassandra datacenter wait \
       --cluster-name ${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --data-center-name "dc1" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --created
   
   echo "✅ Data center operational"
   ```

   The data center configuration provides distributed storage and compute resources optimized for Cassandra workloads. This setup ensures automatic load balancing across nodes and provides the foundation for horizontal scaling as your data requirements grow.

3. **Configure Azure Monitor Diagnostic Settings**:

   Azure Monitor diagnostic settings enable comprehensive logging and metrics collection for your Cassandra cluster. These settings capture critical operational data including query performance, audit logs, and system metrics. By configuring diagnostic settings, you establish the data pipeline that feeds into your monitoring dashboards and alerting systems.

   ```bash
   # Create Log Analytics workspace for diagnostics
   WORKSPACE_NAME="law-cassandra-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
       --workspace-name ${WORKSPACE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION}
   
   WORKSPACE_ID=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
       --workspace-name ${WORKSPACE_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query id --output tsv)
   
   # Get Cassandra cluster resource ID
   CASSANDRA_RESOURCE_ID=$(az managed-cassandra cluster show \
       --cluster-name ${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query id --output tsv)
   
   # Configure diagnostic settings for Cassandra cluster
   az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
       --name "cassandra-diagnostics" \
       --resource ${CASSANDRA_RESOURCE_ID} \
       --workspace ${WORKSPACE_ID} \
       --logs '[{"category":"CassandraLogs","enabled":true},{"category":"CassandraAudit","enabled":true}]' \
       --metrics '[{"category":"AllMetrics","enabled":true}]' \
       --export-to-resource-specific true
   
   echo "✅ Diagnostic settings configured"
   ```

   These diagnostic settings enable resource-specific table storage in Log Analytics, providing optimized query performance and cost-effective data retention. The configuration captures both operational logs and performance metrics essential for comprehensive cluster monitoring.

4. **Deploy Azure Managed Grafana**:

   Azure Managed Grafana provides a fully managed visualization platform optimized for Azure workloads. The service includes built-in integration with Azure Monitor, automatic updates, and enterprise-grade security through Azure Active Directory. This managed approach eliminates the operational burden of maintaining Grafana infrastructure while providing powerful visualization capabilities for complex metrics.

   ```bash
   # Create Azure Managed Grafana instance
   az grafana create \
       --name ${GRAFANA_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku "Standard"
   
   echo "✅ Azure Managed Grafana deployment initiated"
   
   # Wait for Grafana to be ready
   sleep 120
   
   # Get Grafana endpoint
   GRAFANA_ENDPOINT=$(az grafana show \
       --name ${GRAFANA_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query properties.endpoint --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Grafana available at: ${GRAFANA_ENDPOINT}"
   ```

   Azure Managed Grafana automatically provisions with system-assigned managed identity, enabling secure authentication to Azure Monitor without managing service principals. This integration simplifies the connection process while maintaining security best practices.

5. **Configure Grafana Data Source**:

   Connecting Azure Monitor as a data source in Grafana enables real-time visualization of Cassandra metrics and logs. This integration leverages managed identities for secure, passwordless authentication between services. By establishing this connection, you create a seamless pipeline from your database metrics to actionable visualizations.

   ```bash
   # Get Grafana managed identity
   GRAFANA_IDENTITY=$(az grafana show \
       --name ${GRAFANA_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query identity.principalId --output tsv)
   
   # Assign Monitoring Reader role to Grafana identity
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee ${GRAFANA_IDENTITY} \
       --role "Monitoring Reader" \
       --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}"
   
   echo "✅ Grafana permissions configured"
   
   # Create data source configuration
   az grafana data-source create \
       --name ${GRAFANA_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --definition '{
         "name": "Azure Monitor - Cassandra",
         "type": "grafana-azure-monitor-datasource",
         "access": "proxy",
         "jsonData": {
           "azureAuthType": "msi",
           "subscriptionId": "'${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}'"
         }
       }'
   
   echo "✅ Data source configuration created"
   ```

   The managed identity authentication approach provides secure, credential-free access to Azure Monitor data while automatically handling token renewal. This configuration enables Grafana to query metrics and logs without storing sensitive credentials.

6. **Create Monitoring Dashboard**:

   Custom Grafana dashboards provide tailored visualizations for your specific monitoring requirements. By creating dashboards that focus on Cassandra-specific metrics like read/write latency, node health, and replication status, you enable proactive monitoring and rapid issue identification. These dashboards serve as the primary interface for both development and operations teams.

   ```bash
   # Create dashboard JSON configuration
   cat > cassandra-dashboard.json << EOF
   {
     "dashboard": {
       "title": "Cassandra Cluster Monitoring",
       "tags": ["cassandra", "monitoring"],
       "panels": [
         {
           "title": "Node CPU Usage",
           "type": "graph",
           "targets": [
             {
               "azureMonitor": {
                 "resourceGroup": "${RESOURCE_GROUP}",
                 "resourceName": "${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME}",
                 "metricDefinition": "Microsoft.DocumentDB/cassandraClusters",
                 "metricName": "CpuUsage",
                 "aggregation": "Average",
                 "timeGrain": "PT1M"
               }
             }
           ],
           "gridPos": {"h": 8, "w": 12, "x": 0, "y": 0}
         },
         {
           "title": "Request Latency",
           "type": "graph",
           "targets": [
             {
               "azureMonitor": {
                 "resourceGroup": "${RESOURCE_GROUP}",
                 "resourceName": "${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME}",
                 "metricDefinition": "Microsoft.DocumentDB/cassandraClusters",
                 "metricName": "TotalRequestUnits",
                 "aggregation": "Average",
                 "timeGrain": "PT1M"
               }
             }
           ],
           "gridPos": {"h": 8, "w": 12, "x": 12, "y": 0}
         },
         {
           "title": "Storage Usage",
           "type": "graph",
           "targets": [
             {
               "azureMonitor": {
                 "resourceGroup": "${RESOURCE_GROUP}",
                 "resourceName": "${CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME}",
                 "metricDefinition": "Microsoft.DocumentDB/cassandraClusters",
                 "metricName": "DataUsage",
                 "aggregation": "Average",
                 "timeGrain": "PT5M"
               }
             }
           ],
           "gridPos": {"h": 8, "w": 24, "x": 0, "y": 8}
         }
       ],
       "time": {"from": "now-6h", "to": "now"},
       "refresh": "30s"
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Dashboard configuration created"
   echo "Import this dashboard manually via Grafana UI at: ${GRAFANA_ENDPOINT}"
   ```

   This dashboard configuration provides comprehensive visibility into cluster performance, including CPU utilization, request patterns, and storage consumption. The multi-panel layout enables quick identification of performance bottlenecks and resource constraints.

7. **Configure Alerting Rules**:

   Proactive alerting ensures rapid response to performance degradation or system issues. Azure Monitor's alerting capabilities integrate with Azure Managed Grafana to provide threshold-based notifications for critical metrics. By establishing alerting rules for key performance indicators, you create an early warning system that prevents minor issues from escalating into major outages.

   ```bash
   # Create action group for alerts
   az monitor action-group create \
       --name "cassandra-alerts" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --short-name "CassAlert" \
       --email-receiver name="ops-team" email-address="ops@example.com"
   
   # Create metric alert for high CPU usage
   az monitor metrics alert create \
       --name "cassandra-high-cpu" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --scopes ${CASSANDRA_RESOURCE_ID} \
       --condition "avg CpuUsage > 80" \
       --window-size 5m \
       --evaluation-frequency 1m \
       --action "cassandra-alerts" \
       --description "Alert when Cassandra CPU usage exceeds 80%"
   
   # Create alert for storage capacity
   az monitor metrics alert create \
       --name "cassandra-high-storage" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --scopes ${CASSANDRA_RESOURCE_ID} \
       --condition "avg DataUsage > 85" \
       --window-size 15m \
       --evaluation-frequency 5m \
       --action "cassandra-alerts" \
       --description "Alert when storage usage exceeds 85%"
   
   echo "✅ Alerting rules configured"
   ```

   These alerting rules provide automated monitoring for critical performance thresholds, enabling proactive response to resource constraints. The multi-layered alert configuration ensures appropriate escalation timing for different types of issues.
