2. Azure CLI installed and configured (or use Azure Cloud Shell)
3. Basic understanding of serverless architectures and AI content processing
4. Access to Azure OpenAI Service (application approval required)
5. Estimated cost: $15-30 for testing with moderate audio processing and content generation

> **Note**: Azure OpenAI Service requires separate application approval. Apply at https://aka.ms/oaiapply if you haven't already been approved.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-voice-pipeline-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set service-specific variables
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT="stvoicepipe${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export FUNCTION_APP="func-voice-pipeline-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export SPEECH_SERVICE="speech-voice-pipeline-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export OPENAI_SERVICE="openai-voice-pipeline-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export TRANSLATOR_SERVICE="translator-voice-pipeline-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=voice-pipeline environment=demo

echo "✅ Resource group created: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Storage Account for Audio Processing**:

   Azure Blob Storage provides scalable object storage optimized for unstructured data like audio files. Creating a storage account with hierarchical namespace and appropriate access tiers ensures cost-effective storage while enabling event-driven processing through blob triggers that automatically initiate the content pipeline when new audio files are uploaded.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account with blob change feed enabled
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2 \
       --enable-hierarchical-namespace false \
       --allow-blob-public-access false
   
   # Get storage connection string
   STORAGE_CONNECTION=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query connectionString --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Storage account created: ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}"
   ```

   The storage account now provides secure, scalable storage for audio files and processed content. This configuration enables the serverless pipeline to automatically respond to file uploads while maintaining security through disabled public access and efficient storage management.

2. **Create Storage Containers for Pipeline Data**:

   Organizing storage into dedicated containers separates concerns and enables fine-grained access control throughout the processing pipeline. The input container receives raw audio files, while the output container stores processed multilingual content with appropriate lifecycle policies for cost optimization.

   ```bash
   # Create containers for input audio and output content
   az storage container create \
       --name "audio-input" \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --connection-string ${STORAGE_CONNECTION} \
       --public-access off
   
   az storage container create \
       --name "content-output" \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --connection-string ${STORAGE_CONNECTION} \
       --public-access off
   
   echo "✅ Storage containers created for audio input and content output"
   ```

   The container structure provides organized data flow management with appropriate security boundaries. This separation enables different access policies and lifecycle management for input audio files versus generated multilingual content.

3. **Deploy Azure Speech Service for Transcription**:

   Azure Speech Service provides enterprise-grade speech-to-text capabilities with support for multiple languages, speaker diarization, and custom models. The Standard pricing tier offers optimal balance of features and cost for production workloads while supporting both real-time and batch transcription scenarios.

   ```bash
   # Create Speech service resource
   az cognitiveservices account create \
       --name ${SPEECH_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --kind SpeechServices \
       --sku S0 \
       --custom-domain ${SPEECH_SERVICE}
   
   # Get Speech service key and endpoint
   SPEECH_KEY=$(az cognitiveservices account keys list \
       --name ${SPEECH_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query key1 --output tsv)
   
   SPEECH_ENDPOINT=$(az cognitiveservices account show \
       --name ${SPEECH_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query properties.endpoint --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Speech service deployed: ${SPEECH_SERVICE}"
   ```

   The Speech service is now configured for high-accuracy transcription with enterprise security and scalability. This service will convert uploaded audio files into text transcripts that serve as input for content enhancement and translation processes.

4. **Deploy Azure OpenAI Service for Content Enhancement**:

   Azure OpenAI Service provides access to advanced GPT models with enterprise security, compliance, and responsible AI features. The service enables intelligent text enhancement, formatting, and content generation while maintaining data privacy and implementing content filtering for safe AI-powered content creation.

   ```bash
   # Create Azure OpenAI service resource
   az cognitiveservices account create \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --kind OpenAI \
       --sku S0 \
       --custom-domain ${OPENAI_SERVICE}
   
   # Get OpenAI service key and endpoint
   OPENAI_KEY=$(az cognitiveservices account keys list \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query key1 --output tsv)
   
   OPENAI_ENDPOINT=$(az cognitiveservices account show \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query properties.endpoint --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Azure OpenAI service deployed: ${OPENAI_SERVICE}"
   ```

   The OpenAI service provides intelligent content enhancement capabilities that transform raw transcripts into polished, engaging content. This service will improve readability, add structure, and enhance the overall quality of transcribed text before translation.

5. **Deploy Azure Translator for Multilingual Processing**:

   Azure Translator offers neural machine translation across 135+ languages with custom terminology support and document translation capabilities. The service integrates seamlessly with content pipelines to provide consistent, high-quality translations while preserving formatting and context from enhanced content.

   ```bash
   # Create Translator service resource
   az cognitiveservices account create \
       --name ${TRANSLATOR_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --kind TextTranslation \
       --sku S1 \
       --custom-domain ${TRANSLATOR_SERVICE}
   
   # Get Translator service key and endpoint
   TRANSLATOR_KEY=$(az cognitiveservices account keys list \
       --name ${TRANSLATOR_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query key1 --output tsv)
   
   TRANSLATOR_ENDPOINT=$(az cognitiveservices account show \
       --name ${TRANSLATOR_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query properties.endpoint --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Translator service deployed: ${TRANSLATOR_SERVICE}"
   ```

   The Translator service enables professional-quality multilingual content generation with support for industry-specific terminology and cultural localization. This completes the AI services foundation for the automated content pipeline.

6. **Create Azure Functions App for Pipeline Orchestration**:

   Azure Functions provides serverless compute for event-driven processing with automatic scaling and integrated monitoring. The consumption plan offers cost-effective execution based on actual usage while supporting blob triggers for seamless integration with storage events and complex orchestration workflows.

   ```bash
   # Create Azure Functions app with consumption plan
   az functionapp create \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --storage-account ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --consumption-plan-location ${LOCATION} \
       --runtime python \
       --runtime-version 3.11 \
       --functions-version 4
   
   echo "✅ Function App created: ${FUNCTION_APP}"
   ```

   The Function App provides the computational foundation for orchestrating the entire content pipeline. This serverless platform automatically scales based on processing demand while maintaining cost efficiency through pay-per-execution pricing with the latest Python 3.11 runtime for optimal performance.

7. **Configure Function App Settings with Service Credentials**:

   Application settings provide secure, centralized configuration management for all AI service credentials and endpoints. These settings enable functions to authenticate with cognitive services while maintaining security best practices through managed configuration rather than hardcoded credentials.

   ```bash
   # Configure function app settings with service credentials
   az functionapp config appsettings set \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --settings \
           "SPEECH_KEY=${SPEECH_KEY}" \
           "SPEECH_ENDPOINT=${SPEECH_ENDPOINT}" \
           "OPENAI_KEY=${OPENAI_KEY}" \
           "OPENAI_ENDPOINT=${OPENAI_ENDPOINT}" \
           "TRANSLATOR_KEY=${TRANSLATOR_KEY}" \
           "TRANSLATOR_ENDPOINT=${TRANSLATOR_ENDPOINT}" \
           "STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=${STORAGE_CONNECTION}" \
           "TARGET_LANGUAGES=es,fr,de,ja,pt"
   
   echo "✅ Function app configured with AI service credentials"
   ```

   The function app now has secure access to all required AI services with centralized credential management. The TARGET_LANGUAGES setting defines which languages the pipeline will automatically generate, covering major global markets including Spanish, French, German, Japanese, and Portuguese.

8. **Deploy Pipeline Processing Function Code**:

   The processing function orchestrates the complete pipeline by coordinating speech transcription, content enhancement, and multilingual translation. This implementation uses asynchronous processing patterns and error handling to ensure reliable operation while maintaining processing efficiency and quality control.

   ```bash
