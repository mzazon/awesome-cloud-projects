## Steps

1. **Create Azure DevOps Project with Advanced Features**:

   Azure DevOps provides integrated project management, version control, and CI/CD capabilities that form the foundation of intelligent code quality pipelines. Creating a project with proper configuration enables comprehensive tracking of code changes, automated testing, and quality metrics following Azure Well-Architected Framework operational excellence principles.

   ```bash
   # Create new Azure DevOps project
   az devops project create \
       --name ${PROJECT_NAME} \
       --description "Intelligent Code Quality Pipeline Demo" \
       --process Agile \
       --source-control Git \
       --visibility private
   
   # Get project ID for reference
   export PROJECT_ID=$(az devops project show \
       --project ${PROJECT_NAME} \
       --query id --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Azure DevOps project created: ${PROJECT_NAME}"
   echo "Project ID: ${PROJECT_ID}"
   ```

   The project is now configured with Git version control, Agile work item tracking, and pipeline capabilities. This foundation enables comprehensive code quality management with built-in traceability from requirements through deployment, supporting both manual and automated testing workflows.

2. **Configure Application Insights for Performance Monitoring**:

   Application Insights provides real-time application performance monitoring (APM) that captures telemetry data from your applications, enabling intelligent feedback loops based on actual performance metrics. This observability foundation aligns with Azure Well-Architected Framework reliability principles by enabling proactive issue detection.

   ```bash
   # Install Application Insights extension if not already available
   az extension add --name application-insights --allow-preview

   # Create Application Insights resource

       --app ${APP_INSIGHTS_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --kind web \
       --application-type web
   
   # Get connection string (modern approach replacing instrumentation key)
   export CONNECTION_STRING=$(az monitor app-insights component show \
       --app ${APP_INSIGHTS_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query connectionString --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Application Insights configured: ${APP_INSIGHTS_NAME}"
   echo "Connection String: ${CONNECTION_STRING}"
   ```

   Application Insights is now ready to collect performance telemetry, exception tracking, and user behavior data. This monitoring foundation enables the quality pipeline to make informed decisions based on actual application performance and correlate code changes with quality metrics.

3. **Create Storage Account for Logic Apps**:

   Azure Logic Apps requires a storage account for state management and workflow execution data. This storage foundation enables the automated feedback loops and intelligent decision-making capabilities that adapt to team patterns and project requirements over time, supporting Azure Well-Architected Framework cost optimization through efficient resource utilization.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account for Logic Apps

       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2
   
   # Get connection string
   export STORAGE_CONNECTION=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query connectionString --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Storage account created: ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}"
   ```

   The storage account provides the persistent state management required for Logic Apps to maintain context across workflow executions, enabling sophisticated feedback loops and pattern recognition in code quality metrics.

4. **Deploy Logic Apps for Intelligent Feedback Loops**:

     },
     "actions": {
       "Evaluate_Quality_Score": {
         "type": "If",
         "expression": "@greater(triggerBody().qualityScore, 80)",
         "actions": {
           "Send_Success_Notification": {
             "type": "Response",
             "inputs": {
               "statusCode": 200,
               "body": "Quality threshold met - proceeding with deployment"
             }
           }
         },
         "else": {
           "actions": {
             "Send_Failure_Notification": {
               "type": "Response",
               "inputs": {
                 "statusCode": 400,
                 "body": "Quality threshold not met - blocking deployment"
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   EOF

   # Create Logic App workflow
   az logic workflow create \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --definition @logic-app-definition.json
   
   # Get Logic App trigger URL
   export LOGIC_APP_URL=$(az logic workflow show \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query accessEndpoint --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Logic App deployed: ${LOGIC_APP_NAME}"

From a cost perspective, this intelligent pipeline approach optimizes resource utilization by automating quality gates and reducing manual testing overhead while improving overall software quality. The serverless nature of Logic Apps ensures you only pay for actual workflow executions, while Azure DevOps provides transparent pricing that scales with team size and usage patterns. This solution aligns with Azure Well-Architected Framework cost optimization principles by eliminating waste and improving operational efficiency.

> **Tip**: Use Azure DevOps Analytics to track quality trends over time and identify patterns that indicate process improvements. The [Azure DevOps Analytics documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/dashboards/analytics-overview) provides guidance on creating custom reports that correlate quality metrics with development velocity and team performance indicators.

## Challenge
