# Intelligent Infrastructure ChatBots with Azure Copilot Studio and Azure Monitor

## Problem

IT teams spend countless hours manually querying infrastructure metrics, interpreting alerts, and troubleshooting issues through complex dashboards and command-line interfaces. This reactive approach leads to delayed problem resolution, increased mean time to recovery (MTTR), and reduced team productivity when dealing with routine monitoring tasks that could be automated through conversational AI interfaces.

## Solution

Build an intelligent conversational AI chatbot using Azure Copilot Studio that integrates with Azure Monitor to provide natural language queries for infrastructure metrics, proactive alerts, and guided troubleshooting. This solution enables IT teams to interact with their monitoring data through conversational interfaces, reducing the learning curve and accelerating incident response while following Azure Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure subscription with appropriate permissions to create resources
2. Azure CLI v2.50.0 or later installed and configured (or Azure Cloud Shell)
3. Basic understanding of conversational AI concepts and Azure monitoring
4. Existing Azure resources to monitor (Virtual Machines, App Services, or Storage Accounts)
5. Power Platform developer license or trial for Azure Copilot Studio
6. Estimated cost: $10-20 per day for Function Apps and Log Analytics workspace

> **Note**: This recipe assumes you have basic Azure Monitor data already being collected. If you need to set up monitoring first, review the [Azure Monitor documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/).

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-chatbot-infrastructure-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Define resource names
export FUNCTION_APP_NAME="func-infra-bot-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="stinfrabot${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE="law-infra-bot-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export APP_INSIGHTS_NAME="ai-infra-bot-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=infrastructure-chatbot environment=demo

echo "✅ Resource group created: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"

# Create Log Analytics workspace for monitoring data
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --workspace-name ${LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --sku PerGB2018

echo "✅ Log Analytics workspace created: ${LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Azure Functions App for Query Processing**:

   Azure Functions provides the serverless compute foundation for processing natural language queries and converting them into KQL (Kusto Query Language) statements for Azure Monitor. This serverless approach ensures cost-effective scaling and eliminates infrastructure management overhead while providing the integration layer between Azure Copilot Studio and Azure Monitor APIs.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account for Function App
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2
   
   # Create Function App with consumption plan using latest Python runtime
   az functionapp create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --consumption-plan-location ${LOCATION} \
       --runtime python \
       --runtime-version 3.11 \
       --functions-version 4 \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP_NAME} \
       --storage-account ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --os-type Linux
   
   echo "✅ Function App created with serverless compute model"
   ```

   The Function App now provides a scalable, event-driven compute platform that can process chatbot queries on-demand. This setup enables seamless integration between conversational AI and Azure Monitor data, automatically scaling based on user interactions while supporting the latest Python runtime versions.

2. **Configure Application Insights for Function Monitoring**:

   Application Insights enables comprehensive monitoring of the Function App performance and user interactions, providing valuable telemetry for optimizing the chatbot experience. This monitoring layer helps identify bottlenecks, track usage patterns, and ensure reliable service delivery for IT teams.

   ```bash
   # Create Application Insights resource
   az monitor app-insights component create \
       --app ${APP_INSIGHTS_NAME} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --workspace ${LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE}
   
   # Get Application Insights connection string (preferred over instrumentation key)
   APPINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az monitor app-insights component show \
       --app ${APP_INSIGHTS_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query connectionString --output tsv)
   
   # Configure Function App with Application Insights using connection string
   az functionapp config appsettings set \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --settings "APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=${APPINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING}"
   
   echo "✅ Application Insights configured with connection string"
   ```

   The monitoring infrastructure now captures detailed performance metrics, dependency tracking, and user behavior analytics using the modern connection string approach. This foundation enables continuous improvement of the chatbot experience and proactive identification of infrastructure issues while adhering to current Azure Application Insights best practices.

3. **Deploy Query Processing Function**:

   This step creates the core function that translates natural language queries into KQL statements and retrieves data from Azure Monitor. The function acts as an intelligent middleware layer that understands common IT queries and formats responses appropriately for conversational interfaces.

   ```bash
   # Create temporary directory for function code
   mkdir -p /tmp/chatbot-functions
   cd /tmp/chatbot-functions
   
   # Create function structure
   mkdir -p QueryProcessor
   
   # Create function.json for HTTP trigger
   cat > QueryProcessor/function.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "bindings": [
       {
         "authLevel": "function",
         "type": "httpTrigger",
         "direction": "in",

         "methods": ["post"]
       },
       {
         "type": "http",
         "direction": "out",
         "name": "$return"
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF

   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   
   def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
       logging.info('Processing infrastructure query request')
       
       try:
           # Parse request body
           req_body = req.get_json()
           user_query = req_body.get('query', '')
           
           # Initialize Azure Monitor client with managed identity
           credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
           client = LogsQueryClient(credential)
           
           # Convert natural language to KQL
           kql_query = convert_to_kql(user_query)
           
           # Execute query against Log Analytics
           workspace_id = os.environ['LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID']
           response = client.query_workspace(
               workspace_id=workspace_id,
               query=kql_query,
               timespan=timedelta(hours=1)
           )
           
           # Format response for chatbot
           formatted_response = format_response(response)
           
           return func.HttpResponse(
               json.dumps(formatted_response),
               mimetype="application/json",
               status_code=200
           )
           
       except Exception as e:
           logging.error(f"Error processing query: {str(e)}")
           return func.HttpResponse(
               json.dumps({"error": "Failed to process query"}),
               mimetype="application/json",
               status_code=500

       if not response.tables:
           return {"message": "No data found for your query"}
       
       table = response.tables[0]
       results = []
       
       for row in table.rows:
           result = {}
           for i, column in enumerate(table.columns):
               result[column.name] = row[i]
           results.append(result)
       
       return {
           "message": "Here are your infrastructure metrics:",
           "data": results[:5]  # Limit to top 5 results
       }
   EOF
   
   # Create requirements.txt with latest package versions
   cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'

   azure-monitor-query>=1.3.0
   azure-identity>=1.15.0
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Function code created with KQL query processing capabilities"
   ```

   The query processing function now provides intelligent translation of natural language queries into actionable KQL statements. This enables IT teams to ask questions like "show me CPU usage" or "which servers have low memory" and receive formatted responses suitable for conversational interfaces, utilizing the latest Azure SDK versions for optimal performance and security.

4. **Deploy Function Code to Azure**:

   Deploying the function code to Azure makes the query processing capabilities available to Azure Copilot Studio. This step establishes the serverless backend that handles the complex data retrieval and formatting tasks required for intelligent infrastructure monitoring conversations.

       --name ${FUNCTION_APP_NAME} \
       --src chatbot-functions.zip
   
   # Get Log Analytics workspace ID for configuration
   WORKSPACE_ID=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --workspace-name ${LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE} \
       --query customerId --output tsv)
   
   # Configure function app settings
   az functionapp config appsettings set \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --settings "LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID=${WORKSPACE_ID}"
   
   # Enable managed identity for secure access
   az functionapp identity assign \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
   
   # Get the managed identity principal ID
   FUNCTION_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az functionapp identity show \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query principalId --output tsv)
   
   # Grant Log Analytics Reader role to the managed identity
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee ${FUNCTION_PRINCIPAL_ID} \
       --role "Log Analytics Reader" \
       --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/${LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE}"
   
   echo "✅ Function deployed with secure Azure Monitor integration"
   ```

   The function is now deployed and configured with the necessary permissions and settings to query Azure Monitor data securely using managed identity. This establishes the foundation for the chatbot to access real-time infrastructure metrics and respond to user queries with current data while following Azure security best practices.

5. **Configure Azure Copilot Studio Bot**:

   Azure Copilot Studio provides the conversational AI platform that enables natural language interaction with infrastructure monitoring data.

         "function_endpoint": "QueryProcessor",
         "parameters": {
           "query": "memory"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "Disk Space Query",
         "trigger_phrases": [
           "disk space",
           "storage usage",
           "free space",
           "disk utilization"
         ],
         "response_action": "call_function",
         "function_endpoint": "QueryProcessor",
         "parameters": {
           "query": "disk"
         }
       },
       {
         "name": "Server Health Check",
         "trigger_phrases": [
           "server health",
           "system status",
           "online servers",
           "server availability"
         ],
         "response_action": "call_function",
         "function_endpoint": "QueryProcessor",
         "parameters": {
           "query": "health"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Conversational topics configured for infrastructure monitoring"
