    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --sku Standard_LRS \
    --kind StorageV2 \
    --access-tier Hot

echo "✅ Storage account created: ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Azure Migrate Project**:

   Azure Migrate provides a centralized hub for discovering, assessing, and migrating on-premises workloads to Azure. The migrate project serves as the foundation for collecting comprehensive workload data including performance metrics, dependencies, and configuration details that will feed into our AI analysis pipeline. This service provides unified migration capabilities with support for multiple target architectures and modernization pathways.

   ```bash
   # Note: Azure Migrate projects are now created through the Azure portal
   # This demonstrates the conceptual approach for migration project setup
   
   # Create a resource group specifically for migration resources if needed
   az group create \
       --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP}-migrate \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --tags purpose=azure-migrate environment=demo
   
   echo "✅ Migration resource group prepared for Azure Migrate project"
   echo "Create your Azure Migrate project in the Azure portal at:"
   echo "https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureMigrate"
   echo "Project name: ${MIGRATE_PROJECT}"
   echo "Resource group: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}-migrate"
   echo "Location: ${LOCATION}"
   ```

   The Azure Migrate project provides the foundation for workload discovery and assessment. This centralized approach ensures all migration data is systematically collected and can be processed by our AI analysis system for intelligent modernization recommendations. Azure Migrate now includes enhanced dependency analysis and application assessment capabilities that provide comprehensive insights into workload relationships.

2. **Deploy Azure OpenAI Service**:

   Azure OpenAI Service provides enterprise-grade AI capabilities with built-in security, compliance, and regional availability. This managed service enables sophisticated analysis of migration data, pattern recognition, and generation of actionable modernization recommendations while maintaining data privacy and security standards compliant with Azure's comprehensive security framework.

   ```bash
   # Create Azure OpenAI Service
   az cognitiveservices account create \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --kind OpenAI \
       --sku S0 \
       --custom-domain ${OPENAI_SERVICE}
   
   # Get OpenAI service endpoint and key
   OPENAI_ENDPOINT=$(az cognitiveservices account show \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query properties.endpoint \
       --output tsv)
   
   OPENAI_KEY=$(az cognitiveservices account keys list \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query key1 \
       --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Azure OpenAI Service deployed: ${OPENAI_SERVICE}"
   ```

   The OpenAI service is now ready to analyze migration data and generate intelligent insights. This AI-powered analysis capability enables automated pattern recognition and recommendation generation that would be time-consuming and error-prone if performed manually, providing accelerated assessment capabilities aligned with Microsoft Copilot in Azure features.

3. **Deploy GPT Model for Analysis**:

   GPT models excel at analyzing structured and unstructured data, making them ideal for processing migration assessment results and generating human-readable modernization recommendations. The model deployment provides the cognitive capabilities needed to transform raw migration data into actionable business insights with contextual understanding of Azure service capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Deploy GPT-4 model for analysis
   az cognitiveservices account deployment create \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --deployment-name gpt-4-migration-analysis \
       --model-name gpt-4 \
       --model-version "0125-preview" \
       --model-format OpenAI \
       --sku-capacity 20 \
       --sku-name Standard
   
   # Wait for deployment to complete
   sleep 30
   
   # Verify deployment status
   az cognitiveservices account deployment show \
       --name ${OPENAI_SERVICE} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --deployment-name gpt-4-migration-analysis \
       --query properties.provisioningState \
       --output tsv
   
   echo "✅ GPT-4 model deployed for migration analysis"
   ```

   The GPT-4 model deployment provides advanced natural language processing capabilities for analyzing migration data patterns, identifying optimization opportunities, and generating comprehensive modernization recommendations with business context and technical detail that align with Azure Well-Architected Framework principles.

4. **Create Azure Function for AI Processing**:

   Azure Functions provides serverless compute capabilities that automatically scale based on workload demands. This event-driven architecture ensures efficient processing of migration assessment data while maintaining cost-effectiveness through consumption-based pricing and automatic resource management, supporting the serverless architecture patterns recommended in Azure migration strategies.

   ```bash
   # Create Function App with consumption plan
   az functionapp create \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --storage-account ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --consumption-plan-location ${LOCATION} \
       --runtime python \
       --runtime-version 3.11 \
       --functions-version 4 \
       --os-type Linux
   
   # Configure application settings for OpenAI integration
   az functionapp config appsettings set \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --settings \
           "OPENAI_ENDPOINT=${OPENAI_ENDPOINT}" \
           "OPENAI_KEY=${OPENAI_KEY}" \
           "OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4-migration-analysis" \
           "MIGRATE_PROJECT=${MIGRATE_PROJECT}" \
           "STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az storage account show-connection-string --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --query connectionString --output tsv)"
   
   echo "✅ Function App created and configured: ${FUNCTION_APP}"
   ```

   The Function App is now configured with secure access to both Azure OpenAI Service and storage resources. This serverless architecture enables automatic scaling and cost-effective processing of migration assessment data as it becomes available, following Azure security best practices for secrets management.

5. **Create Storage Containers for Assessment Data**:

   Azure Storage provides secure, scalable storage for migration assessment data and AI-generated insights. The hierarchical organization ensures efficient data access patterns while maintaining security boundaries between raw assessment data and processed intelligence outputs, supporting data governance requirements for enterprise migration projects.

   ```bash
   # Get storage account key
   STORAGE_KEY=$(az storage account keys list \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --query '[0].value' \
       --output tsv)
   
   # Create containers for assessment data and AI insights
   az storage container create \
       --name assessment-data \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --account-key ${STORAGE_KEY} \
       --public-access off
   
   az storage container create \
       --name ai-insights \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --account-key ${STORAGE_KEY} \
       --public-access off
   
   az storage container create \
       --name modernization-reports \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --account-key ${STORAGE_KEY} \
       --public-access off
   
   echo "✅ Storage containers created for assessment data and AI insights"
   ```

   The storage containers provide organized data management with secure access controls. This structure enables efficient data flow from migration assessment through AI processing to final report generation while maintaining data governance and security standards required for enterprise migration scenarios.

       --output tsv
   
   # Verify function deployment
   az functionapp function show \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name ${FUNCTION_APP} \
       --function-name migrate-ai-assessment \
       --query name \
       --output tsv
   ```

   Expected output: Function app state should be `Running` and function should be successfully deployed.

4. **Test End-to-End Assessment Processing**:

   ```bash
   # List AI insights generated
   az storage blob list \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --account-key ${STORAGE_KEY} \
       --container-name ai-insights \
       --output table
   
   # Download and review AI insights
   az storage blob download \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --account-key ${STORAGE_KEY} \
       --container-name ai-insights \
       --name assessment-unknown.json \
       --file /tmp/ai-insights.json
   
   cat /tmp/ai-insights.json
   ```

   Expected output: AI insights should contain structured modernization recommendations with cost optimization, sustainability considerations, and performance improvement suggestions.

   ```bash
   # Delete resource group and all remaining resources
   az group delete \
       --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --yes \
       --no-wait
   
   echo "✅ Resource group deletion initiated: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"
   echo "Note: Deletion may take several minutes to complete"
   ```

## Discussion

This intelligent workload modernization assessment solution demonstrates the powerful combination of Azure Migrate's comprehensive discovery capabilities with Azure OpenAI Service's advanced analytical intelligence. By automating the analysis of migration assessment data, organizations can significantly reduce the time and effort required for migration planning while improving the quality of modernization recommendations. The [Azure Migrate documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/) provides comprehensive guidance on assessment methodologies and best practices for cloud migration planning, including the latest enhancements for dependency analysis and application assessment capabilities.

The serverless architecture using Azure Functions ensures cost-effective processing that scales automatically based on assessment workload demands. This event-driven approach aligns with modern cloud-native principles and enables real-time processing of migration data as it becomes available. The integration with Azure OpenAI Service leverages advanced language models to identify patterns and generate insights that would be difficult to achieve through traditional rule-based systems. For detailed information on Azure OpenAI Service capabilities and Microsoft Copilot in Azure integration, refer to the [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/).

The solution addresses key challenges in migration planning by providing intelligent analysis of workload characteristics, dependency mapping, and cost optimization opportunities. By storing assessment data and AI insights in Azure Storage, organizations can build a comprehensive knowledge base that improves over time and supports continuous optimization of their cloud infrastructure. The structured approach to data management ensures compliance with governance requirements while enabling advanced analytics capabilities. This approach aligns with the Azure Well-Architected Framework principles for operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. For storage best practices and security considerations, review the [Azure Storage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/).

> **Tip**: Consider implementing Azure Logic Apps or Azure Data Factory for more complex data orchestration scenarios where multiple data sources need to be integrated before AI analysis. This approach can handle enterprise-scale migration projects with diverse on-premises environments and complex dependency relationships, enabling comprehensive assessment workflows that incorporate sustainability insights and compliance requirements.

## Challenge

Extend this solution by implementing these enhancements:

1. **Real-time Assessment Dashboard**: Create a Power BI dashboard that visualizes AI-generated insights and tracks migration progress with real-time updates from Azure Migrate assessments, incorporating sustainability metrics and carbon footprint analysis.

2. **Multi-Cloud Analysis**: Expand the AI analysis to include AWS and Google Cloud migration options, providing comparative recommendations for hybrid and multi-cloud strategies with cost and sustainability comparisons.

3. **Advanced Dependency Mapping**: Integrate with Azure Service Map and Application Insights to provide more sophisticated dependency analysis and impact assessment for complex enterprise applications with microservices architectures.

4. **Cost Prediction Modeling**: Implement machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning to predict long-term cloud costs based on historical usage patterns, growth projections, and Azure pricing changes.

5. **Automated Remediation Workflows**: Create Azure Logic Apps workflows that automatically implement simple modernization recommendations such as VM sizing adjustments, storage tier optimization, or container migration assessments based on AI insights and governance policies.
