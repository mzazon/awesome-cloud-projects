## Prerequisites

1. Azure subscription with appropriate permissions for Data Share, Service Fabric, Key Vault, and Monitor resources
2. Azure CLI v2.50.0 or later installed and configured (or Azure CloudShell)
3. Understanding of microservices architecture and data governance principles
4. Two Azure subscriptions or resource groups to simulate cross-organization sharing
5. Estimated cost: $150-200 per month for test environment (includes Service Fabric cluster, storage, and monitoring)

> **Note**: This recipe demonstrates cross-organization collaboration patterns. In production, implement additional security measures including Azure AD B2B integration and conditional access policies as outlined in the [Azure Data Share security documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-share/security).

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER="rg-data-share-provider-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export RESOURCE_GROUP_CONSUMER="rg-data-share-consumer-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export DATA_SHARE_ACCOUNT="datashare${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export SERVICE_FABRIC_CLUSTER="sf-governance-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export KEY_VAULT_PROVIDER="kv-provider-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export KEY_VAULT_CONSUMER="kv-consumer-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export STORAGE_PROVIDER="stprovider${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export STORAGE_CONSUMER="stconsumer${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create resource groups for provider and consumer
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=data-share-demo environment=provider

az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP_CONSUMER} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=data-share-demo environment=consumer

echo "✅ Resource groups created for cross-organization demo"

# Register required resource providers
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DataShare
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ServiceFabric
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KeyVault

echo "✅ Resource providers registered successfully"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Storage Accounts for Data Repositories**:

   Azure Storage provides the foundational data repositories for cross-organization sharing scenarios. Creating separate storage accounts for provider and consumer organizations establishes clear data boundaries and enables independent management of data access patterns. This separation is crucial for maintaining data sovereignty and implementing proper governance controls in multi-tenant data sharing architectures.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account for data provider
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_PROVIDER} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2 \
       --access-tier Hot \
       --https-only true
   
   # Create storage account for data consumer
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_CONSUMER} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_CONSUMER} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2 \
       --access-tier Hot \
       --https-only true
   
   echo "✅ Storage accounts created for provider and consumer organizations"
   ```

   The storage accounts now provide secure, scalable repositories for data sharing workflows. These accounts serve as the source and destination for Azure Data Share operations, with built-in encryption and access control capabilities that form the foundation of the secure data collaboration platform.

2. **Create Azure Key Vaults for Secrets Management**:

   Azure Key Vault provides centralized, secure storage for cryptographic keys, certificates, and secrets used in cross-organization data sharing. Implementing separate Key Vaults for each organization ensures proper secret isolation while enabling secure credential exchange through the Service Fabric governance layer. This approach follows zero-trust security principles and supports regulatory compliance requirements.

   ```bash
   # Create Key Vault for data provider
   az keyvault create \
       --name ${KEY_VAULT_PROVIDER} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku standard \
       --enabled-for-deployment true \
       --enabled-for-template-deployment true
   
   # Create Key Vault for data consumer
   az keyvault create \
       --name ${KEY_VAULT_CONSUMER} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_CONSUMER} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku standard \
       --enabled-for-deployment true \
       --enabled-for-template-deployment true
   
   echo "✅ Key Vaults created for secure credential management"
   ```

   The Key Vaults are now configured to store sensitive information including data share access keys, service principal credentials, and encryption keys. This centralized secrets management enables the Service Fabric microservices to securely access required credentials while maintaining audit trails and supporting key rotation policies.

3. **Deploy Azure Service Fabric Cluster**:

   Azure Service Fabric provides a distributed systems platform optimized for building and managing microservices at scale. Deploying a Service Fabric cluster creates the foundation for data governance microservices that orchestrate cross-organization data sharing workflows. The platform's stateful service capabilities are particularly valuable for maintaining data lineage information and audit trails across long-running data collaboration scenarios.

   ```bash
   # Create Service Fabric cluster with security configuration
   az sf cluster create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --cluster-name ${SERVICE_FABRIC_CLUSTER} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --cert-out-folder ./certs \
       --cert-subject-name "CN=${SERVICE_FABRIC_CLUSTER}.${LOCATION}.cloudapp.azure.com" \
       --vault-name ${KEY_VAULT_PROVIDER} \
       --vault-rg ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --cluster-size 5 \
       --vm-sku Standard_D2s_v3 \
       --os WindowsServer2019Datacenter
   
   echo "✅ Service Fabric cluster deployed with security certificates"
   ```

   The Service Fabric cluster is now operational with built-in security features including certificate-based node authentication and encrypted inter-service communication. This managed platform automatically handles service placement, health monitoring, and rolling updates, providing the reliable foundation needed for critical data governance workloads.

4. **Create Azure Data Share Account**:

   Azure Data Share enables secure, managed sharing of data across organizational boundaries with built-in governance controls and audit capabilities. Creating a Data Share account establishes the central hub for managing all data sharing relationships, access permissions, and usage tracking. This service abstracts the complexity of cross-organization data movement while maintaining strict security and compliance controls.

   ```bash
   # Create Azure Data Share account
   az datashare account create \
       --account-name ${DATA_SHARE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --tags purpose=cross-org-collaboration governance=enabled
   
   # Get Data Share account details
   DATASHARE_ACCOUNT_ID=$(az datashare account show \
       --account-name ${DATA_SHARE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --query id --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Azure Data Share account created: ${DATA_SHARE_ACCOUNT}"
   echo "Account ID: ${DATASHARE_ACCOUNT_ID}"
   ```

   The Data Share account provides centralized management for all cross-organization data sharing activities. This managed service handles the complexity of secure data transfer, permission management, and audit logging while enabling data providers to maintain full control over their shared datasets.

5. **Configure Log Analytics Workspace for Monitoring**:

   Azure Monitor and Log Analytics provide comprehensive observability for cross-organization data sharing operations. Creating a centralized Log Analytics workspace enables real-time monitoring of data access patterns, security events, and governance compliance across all components of the data collaboration platform. This monitoring foundation is essential for maintaining audit trails and detecting anomalous behavior in sensitive data sharing scenarios.

   ```bash
   # Create Log Analytics workspace
   az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
       --workspace-name "law-datashare-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku PerGB2018
   
   # Get workspace ID for configuration
   WORKSPACE_ID=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
       --workspace-name "law-datashare-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --query customerId --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Log Analytics workspace created for comprehensive monitoring"
   echo "Workspace ID: ${WORKSPACE_ID}"
   ```

   The Log Analytics workspace now provides centralized log collection and analysis capabilities for the entire data collaboration platform. This observability foundation enables real-time security monitoring, compliance reporting, and performance optimization across all data sharing activities.

6. **Create Sample Dataset for Sharing**:

   Establishing a sample dataset demonstrates the end-to-end data sharing workflow while providing a foundation for testing governance controls and audit trail functionality. This step simulates real-world scenarios where organizations need to share structured data while maintaining strict access controls and usage tracking throughout the data lifecycle.

   ```bash
   # Get storage account key for data upload
   STORAGE_KEY=$(az storage account keys list \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_PROVIDER} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --query '[0].value' --output tsv)
   
   # Create container for shared data
   az storage container create \
       --name "shared-datasets" \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_PROVIDER} \
       --account-key ${STORAGE_KEY} \
       --public-access off
   
   # Create sample CSV data file
   cat > sample_financial_data.csv << EOF
   transaction_id,date,amount,category,region
   TXN001,2025-01-15,15000.00,corporate_loan,north_america
   TXN002,2025-01-16,8500.50,consumer_credit,europe
   TXN003,2025-01-17,22000.75,mortgage,asia_pacific
   TXN004,2025-01-18,3200.25,small_business,north_america
   TXN005,2025-01-19,45000.00,commercial_real_estate,europe
   EOF
   
   # Upload sample data to storage
   az storage blob upload \
       --file sample_financial_data.csv \
       --container-name "shared-datasets" \
       --name "financial_transactions_2025.csv" \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_PROVIDER} \
       --account-key ${STORAGE_KEY}
   
   echo "✅ Sample dataset created and uploaded for sharing demonstration"
   ```

   The sample dataset is now available in secure storage with appropriate access controls. This realistic financial data structure demonstrates common cross-organization sharing scenarios while providing the foundation for testing data governance workflows and audit trail generation.

7. **Create Data Share with Dataset**:

   Creating a data share establishes the formal sharing agreement between organizations, defining access permissions, data refresh schedules, and governance policies. Azure Data Share provides granular control over what data is shared, how frequently it's updated, and who can access it, enabling organizations to maintain sovereignty over their data while facilitating necessary business collaboration.

   ```bash
   # Create data share
   az datashare create \
       --account-name ${DATA_SHARE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --share-name "financial-collaboration-share" \
       --description "Cross-organization financial data sharing for analytics" \
       --share-kind "CopyBased" \
       --terms "Data for internal use only. No redistribution allowed."
   
   # Get storage account resource ID for dataset creation
   STORAGE_RESOURCE_ID=$(az storage account show \
       --name ${STORAGE_PROVIDER} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --query id --output tsv)
   
   # Add dataset to the share using correct JSON format
   az datashare data-set create \
       --account-name ${DATA_SHARE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER} \
       --share-name "financial-collaboration-share" \
       --data-set-name "financial-transactions" \
       --data-set "{\"kind\":\"Blob\",\"properties\":{\"containerName\":\"shared-datasets\",\"filePath\":\"financial_transactions_2025.csv\",\"resourceGroup\":\"${RESOURCE_GROUP_PROVIDER}\",\"storageAccountName\":\"${STORAGE_PROVIDER}\",\"subscriptionId\":\"${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}\"}}"
   
   echo "✅ Data share created with financial dataset"
   ```

   The data share now provides a managed, secure channel for cross-organization data collaboration. This configuration establishes the governance framework that controls data access while enabling the Service Fabric microservices to orchestrate approval workflows, audit logging, and access management processes.

8. **Configure Service Fabric Application for Data Governance**:

   Deploying governance microservices to the Service Fabric cluster creates the orchestration layer that manages cross-organization data sharing workflows. These services handle access request processing, audit trail generation, notification management, and data lineage tracking. The microservices architecture enables independent scaling and updates of different governance functions while maintaining system reliability.

   ```bash
   # Create application package structure for governance services
   mkdir -p ./governance-app/{AccessGovernanceService,AuditTrailService,NotificationService}
   
   # Create Service Fabric application manifest
   cat > ./governance-app/ApplicationManifest.xml << 'EOF'
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                        ApplicationTypeName="DataGovernanceApp"
                        ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0"
                        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
     <ServiceManifestImport>
       <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="AccessGovernanceService" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
     </ServiceManifestImport>
     <ServiceManifestImport>
       <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="AuditTrailService" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
     </ServiceManifestImport>
     <ServiceManifestImport>
       <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="NotificationService" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
     </ServiceManifestImport>
   </ApplicationManifest>
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Service Fabric governance application structure created"
   ```

   The Service Fabric application framework now provides the foundation for deploying data governance microservices. This distributed architecture enables each governance function to operate independently while maintaining strong consistency for audit trails and access control decisions.
