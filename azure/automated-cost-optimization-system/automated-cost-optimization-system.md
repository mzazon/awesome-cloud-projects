## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-cost-optimization-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
export TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set resource names with unique suffixes
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT="stcostopt${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOGIC_APP_NAME="la-cost-optimization-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE="law-cost-optimization-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BUDGET_NAME="budget-optimization-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create resource group for cost optimization resources
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=cost-optimization environment=production

echo "✅ Resource group created: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"

# Create Log Analytics workspace for cost monitoring
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --workspace-name ${LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --sku PerGB2018

echo "✅ Log Analytics workspace created for cost monitoring"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Storage Account for Cost Data Export**:

   Azure Storage provides the foundation for automated cost data analysis and historical trend tracking. Configuring a storage account with proper lifecycle management enables cost-effective long-term storage of cost data exports while maintaining accessibility for analysis workflows.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account for cost data exports
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2 \
       --access-tier Hot \
       --tags purpose=cost-data-export

   # Get storage account connection string
   STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --query connectionString \
       --output tsv)

   # Create container for cost exports
   az storage container create \
       --name cost-exports \
       --connection-string "${STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}" \
       --public-access off

   echo "✅ Storage account configured for cost data exports"
   ```

   The storage account now provides secure, scalable storage for cost data exports with proper access controls. This foundation enables automated cost analysis and historical trend tracking essential for proactive cost optimization.

2. **Configure Azure Cost Management Budget with Automation**:

   Azure Cost Management budgets provide proactive spending control through automated alerts and actions when costs approach defined thresholds. Creating budgets with Action Groups enables immediate response to cost anomalies through Logic Apps integration following Azure Well-Architected Framework cost optimization principles.

   ```bash
   # Get current date for budget period
   START_DATE=$(date -u -d "$(date +%Y-%m-01)" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%3NZ)
   END_DATE=$(date -u -d "$(date +%Y-%m-01) +1 month -1 day" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%3NZ)

   # Create budget with 80% and 100% thresholds
   az consumption budget create \
       --budget-name ${BUDGET_NAME} \
       --amount 1000 \
       --category Cost \
       --start-date ${START_DATE} \
       --end-date ${END_DATE} \
       --time-grain Monthly \
       --time-period start-date=${START_DATE} end-date=${END_DATE}

   # Get budget resource ID for webhook configuration
   BUDGET_ID=$(az consumption budget show \
       --budget-name ${BUDGET_NAME} \
       --query id \
       --output tsv)

   echo "✅ Budget created with automated alert thresholds"
   ```

   The budget configuration establishes spending thresholds that trigger automated responses when costs exceed defined limits. This proactive approach prevents budget overruns through early warning systems and automated remediation actions based on Azure Cost Management best practices.

3. **Create Logic Apps Workflow for Cost Optimization Automation**:

   Azure Logic Apps provides serverless workflow automation that responds to cost alerts and implements optimization actions. This workflow orchestrates the entire cost optimization process from alert detection to remediation implementation using managed identity for secure access.

   ```bash
   # Create Logic Apps workflow
   az logic workflow create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --definition '{
         "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#",
         "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
         "triggers": {
           "manual": {
             "type": "Request",
             "kind": "Http"
           }
         },
         "actions": {}
       }' \
       --tags purpose=cost-optimization-automation

   # Get Logic Apps resource ID
   LOGIC_APP_ID=$(az logic workflow show \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --query id \
       --output tsv)

   echo "✅ Logic Apps workflow created for cost optimization"
   ```

   The Logic Apps workflow now provides the automation engine for cost optimization processes. This serverless approach ensures scalable, reliable execution of optimization actions while maintaining cost efficiency through consumption-based pricing.

4. **Configure Azure Advisor Cost Recommendations Integration**:

   Azure Advisor continuously analyzes resource usage patterns and provides personalized cost optimization recommendations. Integrating these recommendations into automated workflows ensures consistent application of best practices and immediate action on optimization opportunities.

   ```bash
   # Create service principal for Azure Advisor API access
   SP_DETAILS=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac \
       --name "sp-cost-optimization-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --role "Cost Management Reader" \
       --scopes "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}")

   # Extract service principal details
   SP_APP_ID=$(echo ${SP_DETAILS} | jq -r '.appId')
   SP_PASSWORD=$(echo ${SP_DETAILS} | jq -r '.password')

   echo "✅ Azure Advisor integration configured with proper permissions"
   ```

   The service principal configuration enables secure, programmatic access to Azure Advisor recommendations and Cost Management APIs. This authentication mechanism ensures reliable automation while maintaining proper security controls and access limitations following Azure security best practices.

5. **Set Up Cost Anomaly Detection with Azure Monitor**:

   Azure Monitor provides advanced analytics capabilities for detecting unusual spending patterns and cost anomalies. Configuring custom metrics and alerts enables proactive identification of cost optimization opportunities and spending irregularities.

   ```bash
   # Create custom metric for cost anomaly detection
   az monitor metrics alert create \
       --name "cost-anomaly-alert-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --scopes "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}" \
       --condition "avg Microsoft.Consumption/budgets/ActualCost > 800" \
       --window-size 1h \
       --evaluation-frequency 1h \
       --severity 2 \
       --description "Alert when cost exceeds 80% of monthly budget"

   # Get Log Analytics workspace ID
   WORKSPACE_ID=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --workspace-name ${LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE} \
       --query customerId \
       --output tsv)

   echo "✅ Cost anomaly detection configured with Azure Monitor"
   ```

   The anomaly detection system now monitors spending patterns and identifies deviations from normal usage. This intelligent monitoring enables rapid response to cost spikes and proactive optimization of resource utilization.

6. **Create Automated Cost Data Export**:

   Regular cost data exports provide the foundation for trend analysis, forecasting, and detailed cost optimization insights. Automated exports ensure consistent data availability for analysis while reducing manual overhead following Azure data governance principles.

   ```bash
   # Get storage account resource ID
   STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ID="/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}"

   # Create cost data export for daily analysis
   az costmanagement export create \
       --name "daily-cost-export-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --type ActualCost \
       --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}" \
       --storage-account-id ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ID} \
       --storage-container cost-exports \
       --storage-directory exports/daily \
       --timeframe MonthToDate \
       --schedule-status Active \
       --recurrence Daily \
       --recurrence-period from=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d) \
       to=$(date -u -d "+1 year" +%Y-%m-%d)

   echo "✅ Automated cost data export configured for daily analysis"
   ```

   The export configuration ensures consistent availability of cost data for analysis and trend identification. This automated approach enables comprehensive cost optimization insights while maintaining data freshness for accurate decision-making.

7. **Configure Teams Integration for Cost Alerts**:

   Microsoft Teams integration provides immediate visibility into cost optimization activities and alerts for stakeholders. This communication channel ensures rapid response to cost issues and collaborative optimization efforts.

   ```bash
   # Create Teams webhook connector (replace with actual webhook URL)
   TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://outlook.office.com/webhook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"

   # Create Action Group for budget alerts
   az monitor action-group create \
       --name "cost-optimization-alerts-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --short-name "CostOpt" \
       --action logic-app "Cost Optimization Workflow" \
       "${LOGIC_APP_ID}" \
       --tags purpose=cost-optimization-alerts

   echo "✅ Teams integration configured for cost optimization alerts"
   ```

   The Teams integration enables real-time communication about cost optimization activities and ensures stakeholder awareness of spending patterns and optimization opportunities.

8. **Deploy Cost Optimization Workflow Logic**:

   The Logic Apps workflow orchestrates the entire cost optimization process, from receiving alerts to implementing remediation actions. This comprehensive automation ensures consistent application of optimization strategies using Azure native APIs for maximum reliability.

   ```bash
   # Update Logic Apps workflow with full automation logic
   az logic workflow create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --name ${LOGIC_APP_NAME} \
       --definition '{
         "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#",
