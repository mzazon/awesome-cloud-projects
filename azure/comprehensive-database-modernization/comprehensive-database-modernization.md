## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-db-migration-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set specific resource names
export SQL_SERVER_NAME="sqlserver-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export SQL_DATABASE_NAME="modernized-db"
export DMS_SERVICE_NAME="dms-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="stgmigration${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BACKUP_VAULT_NAME="rsv-backup-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOG_ANALYTICS_NAME="la-monitoring-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=database-migration environment=demo

echo "✅ Resource group created: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"

# Create Log Analytics workspace for monitoring
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --workspace-name ${LOG_ANALYTICS_NAME} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --sku PerGB2018

echo "✅ Log Analytics workspace created for monitoring"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Azure SQL Database as Migration Target**:

   Azure SQL Database provides a fully managed, scalable database service that eliminates infrastructure management overhead while delivering enterprise-grade security and performance. This modern database platform automatically handles patching, backups, and high availability, making it ideal for organizations seeking to modernize their database infrastructure with minimal operational complexity.

   ```bash
   # Create Azure SQL Server
   az sql server create \
       --name ${SQL_SERVER_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --admin-user sqladmin \
       --admin-password "ComplexP@ssw0rd123!" \
       --enable-public-network true
   
   # Create Azure SQL Database
   az sql db create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --server ${SQL_SERVER_NAME} \
       --name ${SQL_DATABASE_NAME} \
       --service-objective S2 \
       --backup-storage-redundancy Local
   
   # Configure firewall to allow Azure services
   az sql server firewall-rule create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --server ${SQL_SERVER_NAME} \
       --name AllowAzureServices \
       --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 \
       --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0
   
   echo "✅ Azure SQL Database created and configured"
   ```

   The Azure SQL Database is now ready as the migration target with appropriate security configurations. This foundational step establishes the modern, cloud-native database platform that will host your migrated data with enhanced scalability, security, and built-in high availability features.

2. **Create Storage Account for Migration Assets**:

   Azure Storage provides secure, durable storage for database backup files and migration assets during the modernization process. The storage account serves as an intermediary location for database backups and migration logs, ensuring data integrity and providing audit trails throughout the migration process.

   ```bash
   # Create storage account for migration
   az storage account create \
       --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2 \
       --access-tier Hot \
       --https-only true
   
   # Create container for database backups
   az storage container create \
       --name database-backups \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --public-access off
   
   # Get storage account key for later use
   STORAGE_KEY=$(az storage account keys list \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --query '[0].value' --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Storage account created for migration assets"
   ```

   The storage account is configured with secure access and dedicated containers for migration assets. This centralized storage approach ensures that all migration artifacts are properly organized and accessible to the Database Migration Service while maintaining security best practices.

3. **Create Database Migration Service Instance**:

   Azure Database Migration Service orchestrates the entire migration process, providing assessment capabilities, schema migration, and data transfer with minimal downtime.

   ```

   The Recovery Services Vault is configured to automatically protect your Azure SQL Database with a comprehensive backup strategy. This ensures that your modernized database benefits from automated backups, point-in-time recovery, and long-term retention capabilities that exceed traditional on-premises backup solutions.

5. **Create Database Migration Project**:

   The migration project defines the source and target database configurations, migration settings, and data mapping requirements. This step establishes the framework for transferring schema, data, and database objects while maintaining referential integrity and minimizing downtime during the migration process.

   ```bash
   # Create migration from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database
   # Note: This would typically be configured through Azure Data Studio
   # or the Azure portal for production scenarios
   
   # Store connection information securely
   echo "Migration service ready for configuration"
   echo "Use Azure Data Studio with Azure SQL Migration extension"
   echo "or configure through Azure portal for actual migration"
   
   echo "✅ Migration project framework prepared"
   ```

   The migration project framework is now prepared. In production scenarios, you would use Azure Data Studio with the Azure SQL Migration extension or the Azure portal to configure the actual migration tasks with proper source and target connections.

6. **Configure Azure Monitor for Migration Monitoring**:

   Azure Monitor provides comprehensive observability for the migration process, tracking performance metrics, error rates, and migration progress in real-time. This monitoring capability ensures proactive identification of issues and provides detailed insights into migration performance for optimization and troubleshooting.

   ```bash
   # Create action group for alerts
   az monitor action-group create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name "migration-alerts" \
       --short-name "migration"
   
   # Enable diagnostic settings for SQL Database
   az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
       --resource "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/${SQL_SERVER_NAME}/databases/${SQL_DATABASE_NAME}" \
       --name "sql-diagnostics" \
       --workspace "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/${LOG_ANALYTICS_NAME}" \
       --logs '[{"category": "SQLInsights", "enabled": true}, 
                {"category": "AutomaticTuning", "enabled": true},
                {"category": "QueryStoreRuntimeStatistics", "enabled": true}]' \
       --metrics '[{"category": "Basic", "enabled": true},
                  {"category": "InstanceAndAppAdvanced", "enabled": true}]'
   
   echo "✅ Azure Monitor configured for database monitoring"
   ```

   Azure Monitor is now configured to track database activities with comprehensive logging to Log Analytics. This monitoring infrastructure provides the visibility needed to ensure successful database operations and rapid response to any issues that may arise during and after the modernization process.

7. **Configure SQL Database Backup Protection**:

   Automated backup protection ensures that your modernized database maintains comprehensive data protection with customizable retention periods and recovery options. This step configures Azure Backup to automatically protect your Azure SQL Database with enterprise-grade backup capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Register SQL server for backup
   az backup protectable-item initialize \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --vault-name ${BACKUP_VAULT_NAME} \
       --workload-type AzureSql
   
   # Configure backup for Azure SQL Database
   # Note: Azure SQL Database has built-in automated backups
   # This step demonstrates additional backup vault integration
   echo "Azure SQL Database automatic backups are enabled by default"
   echo "Point-in-time restore available for 7-35 days"
   echo "Long-term retention can be configured separately"
   
   echo "✅ Backup protection configured"
   ```

   The Azure SQL Database now benefits from built-in automated backups with point-in-time restore capabilities. Azure SQL Database automatically provides backup protection without requiring additional Recovery Services Vault configuration, though the vault remains available for other workloads and extended retention policies.

8. **Set Up Monitoring Dashboards and Alerts**:

   Comprehensive monitoring dashboards provide real-time visibility into database performance, backup status, and operational metrics. These dashboards enable proactive management of the modernized database with customizable alerts for critical events and performance thresholds.

   ```bash
   # Create metric alert for database CPU utilization
   az monitor metrics alert create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name "high-cpu-alert" \
       --description "Alert for high CPU utilization" \
       --scopes "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/${SQL_SERVER_NAME}/databases/${SQL_DATABASE_NAME}" \
       --condition "avg cpu_percent > 80" \
       --action-group "migration-alerts" \
       --evaluation-frequency 5m \
       --window-size 15m
   
   # Create alert for database storage usage
   az monitor metrics alert create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name "storage-usage-alert" \
       --description "Alert for high storage usage" \
       --scopes "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/${SQL_SERVER_NAME}/databases/${SQL_DATABASE_NAME}" \
       --condition "avg storage_percent > 85" \
       --action-group "migration-alerts" \
       --evaluation-frequency 5m \
       --window-size 15m
   
   echo "✅ Monitoring dashboards and alerts configured"
   ```
