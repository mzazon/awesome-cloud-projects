# Example Terraform Variables File
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values for your environment

# Required Variables
# =================

# Email address to receive CloudWatch alarm notifications
# You will need to confirm the subscription via email after deployment
email_address = "your-email@example.com"

# AWS region where resources will be created
# Choose a region close to you for better performance
aws_region = "us-west-2"

# Environment Configuration
# ========================

# Environment name for resource tagging (dev, staging, prod)
environment = "dev"

# Prefix for resource names to ensure uniqueness
resource_name_prefix = "monitoring-demo"

# EC2 Instance Configuration
# =========================

# Instance type for the monitoring demo
# t2.micro is free tier eligible
instance_type = "t2.micro"

# Enable detailed monitoring (1-minute metrics instead of 5-minute)
# Note: This may incur additional charges outside of free tier

# CloudWatch Alarm Configuration
# ==============================

# CPU utilization threshold that triggers the alarm (percentage)

# Metric collection period in seconds (300 = 5 minutes)
metric_period = 300

# Security Configuration
# =====================

# Whether to create a new key pair for SSH access
# Set to true if you want to SSH into the instance
create_key_pair = false

# Your SSH public key (required if create_key_pair = true)
# Generate with: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
# Then copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA... your-email@example.com"

# CIDR blocks allowed to access the instance via SSH
# Use your public IP for better security: ["1.2.3.4/32"]
allowed_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

# Enable server-side encryption for SNS topic
enable_sns_encryption = true

# Networking Configuration
# =======================

# Whether to create a new VPC or use the default VPC
# false = use default VPC (recommended for simplicity)
# true = create new VPC with public subnet
create_vpc = false

# CIDR block for new VPC (only used if create_vpc = true)

# CloudWatch Logs Configuration
# =============================

# Number of days to retain CloudWatch logs
# Valid values: 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, 1827, 3653

# Additional Tags
# ==============

# Additional tags to apply to all resources
# These will be merged with the default tags

# Example configurations for different environments:

# Development Environment
# =======================
# environment = "dev"
# instance_type = "t2.micro"
# cpu_alarm_threshold = 70
# enable_detailed_monitoring = false
# create_vpc = false

# Staging Environment
# ==================
# environment = "staging"
# instance_type = "t3.small"
# cpu_alarm_threshold = 80
# enable_detailed_monitoring = true
# create_vpc = true

# Production Environment
# =====================
# environment = "prod"
