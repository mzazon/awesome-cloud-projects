# Archiving Data with S3 Intelligent Tiering


## Problem

Your organization generates large volumes of data with unpredictable access patterns and wants to minimize storage costs while maintaining accessibility. You need a solution that automatically optimizes storage costs based on actual data usage patterns without manual intervention. Traditional static storage class assignments either result in high costs for rarely accessed data or poor performance for frequently accessed files. Additionally, your organization has sustainability goals that require minimizing the environmental impact of data storage infrastructure.

## Solution

Implement an intelligent data archiving strategy using S3 Intelligent-Tiering combined with lifecycle policies and storage analytics. This solution automatically moves objects between storage tiers based on changing access patterns, provides visibility into storage usage and environmental impact, and includes automated monitoring to optimize both cost and carbon footprint.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS account with permissions to create S3 buckets, IAM roles, and Lambda functions
2. AWS CLI v2 installed and configured
3. Basic understanding of S3 storage classes and pricing
4. Sample data for testing (at least 1 GB recommended)
5. Understanding of organizational sustainability goals and metrics
6. Estimated cost: S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitoring at $0.0025/1,000 objects/month, Lambda costs ~$0.20/million invocations, CloudWatch metrics ~$0.30/metric/month

> **Note**: S3 Intelligent-Tiering has monitoring charges of $0.0025 per 1,000 objects monthly. For objects larger than 128KB that are accessed infrequently, the automatic cost optimization typically provides significant savings that exceed monitoring costs.

## Preparation

Set up environment variables and prepare the foundational components:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity \
	--query Account --output text)

# Generate unique bucket name
RANDOM_STRING=$(aws secretsmanager get-random-password \
	--exclude-punctuation --exclude-uppercase \
	--password-length 6 --require-each-included-type \
	--output text --query RandomPassword)

export ARCHIVE_BUCKET="sustainable-archive-${RANDOM_STRING}"
export ANALYTICS_BUCKET="archive-analytics-${RANDOM_STRING}"

echo "Archive bucket: $ARCHIVE_BUCKET"
echo "Analytics bucket: $ANALYTICS_BUCKET"
```

## Steps

1. **Create S3 Bucket with Sustainability-Focused Configuration**:

   Amazon S3 provides 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability and serves as the foundation for sustainable data archiving. Creating a dedicated bucket with versioning and proper tagging establishes the security and compliance baseline required for enterprise data governance. The bucket will serve as the primary storage repository where Intelligent-Tiering can automatically optimize costs and environmental impact based on access patterns.

```bash
# Create the main archive bucket
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--region $AWS_REGION

# Enable versioning for data protection
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

# Add sustainability-focused tags
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--tagging 'TagSet=[
		{Key=Purpose,Value=SustainableArchive},
		{Key=Environment,Value=Production},
		{Key=CostOptimization,Value=Enabled},
		{Key=SustainabilityGoal,Value=CarbonNeutral}
	]'

echo "✅ Archive bucket created with sustainability tagging"
```

   The bucket is now configured with versioning for data protection and tagged for sustainability tracking. These tags enable cost allocation reporting and environmental impact analysis, forming the foundation for comprehensive sustainability governance across your data infrastructure.

2. **Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering for Automatic Cost Optimization**:

   S3 Intelligent-Tiering revolutionizes storage cost management by automatically monitoring access patterns and moving objects between storage tiers without performance impact or operational overhead. Unlike traditional static storage classes that require manual management, Intelligent-Tiering provides dynamic optimization that adapts to changing business needs while reducing both costs and carbon footprint.

```bash
# Create Intelligent-Tiering configuration with all tiers
aws s3api put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration \
	--bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--id SustainableArchiveConfig \
	--intelligent-tiering-configuration '{
		"Id": "SustainableArchiveConfig",
		"Status": "Enabled",
		"Filter": {},
		"Tiering": {
			"Days": 1
		},
		"OptionalFields": [
			{
				"BucketKeyEnabled": true
			}
		]
	}'

echo "✅ Intelligent-Tiering configured for optimal sustainability"
```

   Intelligent-Tiering is now active and will begin monitoring object access patterns immediately. Objects will automatically transition to the Infrequent Access tier after 30 days of no access, and to Archive tiers after 90+ days, delivering immediate cost savings and environmental benefits without any application changes required.

3. **Configure Advanced Archive Tiers for Long-Term Data Retention**:

   Advanced Intelligent-Tiering configurations enable deeper cost optimization by automatically transitioning data to Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tiers. These configurations are particularly valuable for compliance data, backup files, and historical records that have unpredictable access patterns but must remain instantly accessible when needed. The prefix-based filtering allows granular control over which data follows more aggressive archiving policies.

```bash
# Configure Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tiers
aws s3api put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration \
	--bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--id AdvancedSustainableConfig \
	--intelligent-tiering-configuration '{
		"Id": "AdvancedSustainableConfig",
		"Status": "Enabled",
		"Filter": {
			"Prefix": "long-term/"
		},
		"Tiering": {
			"Days": 1
		},
		"OptionalFields": [
			{
				"BucketKeyEnabled": true
			}
		]
	}'

echo "✅ Advanced Intelligent-Tiering with archive tiers configured"
```

   The advanced configuration specifically targets the "long-term/" prefix for deeper archiving, enabling up to 80% cost reduction for rarely accessed data while maintaining instant accessibility. This granular approach ensures business-critical active data remains in optimal tiers while historical data achieves maximum cost and environmental efficiency.

4. **Implement Comprehensive Lifecycle Policies for Sustainability Optimization**:

   S3 Lifecycle policies complement Intelligent-Tiering by managing object versions, incomplete uploads, and permanent deletions based on business requirements. These policies ensure that non-current versions follow appropriate retention schedules while automatically cleaning up incomplete multipart uploads that consume storage without providing value. This comprehensive approach maximizes both cost efficiency and environmental sustainability.

```bash
# Create lifecycle policy for sustainability optimization
cat > lifecycle-policy.json << EOF
{
	"Rules": [
		{
			"ID": "SustainabilityOptimization",
			"Status": "Enabled",
			"Filter": {},
			"Transitions": [
				{
					"Days": 0,
					"StorageClass": "INTELLIGENT_TIERING"
				}
			],
			"NoncurrentVersionTransitions": [
				{
					"NoncurrentDays": 30,
					"StorageClass": "GLACIER"
				},
				{
					"NoncurrentDays": 90,
					"StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
				}
			],
			"AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload": {
				"DaysAfterInitiation": 1
			}
		},
		{
			"ID": "DeleteOldVersions",
			"Status": "Enabled",
			"Filter": {},
			"NoncurrentVersionExpiration": {
				"NoncurrentDays": 365
			}
		}
	]
}
EOF

aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
	--bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle-policy.json

echo "✅ Lifecycle policy applied for comprehensive optimization"
```

   The lifecycle policy now ensures that all objects immediately use Intelligent-Tiering, non-current versions transition to long-term storage after 30 days, and incomplete uploads are cleaned up within 24 hours. This policy framework eliminates storage waste and ensures optimal cost and environmental efficiency throughout the entire data lifecycle.

5. **Deploy S3 Storage Lens for Comprehensive Sustainability Analytics**:

   Amazon S3 Storage Lens provides organization-wide visibility into storage usage patterns, cost optimization opportunities, and sustainability metrics. By configuring Storage Lens with detailed activity metrics and prefix-level analysis, organizations can identify underutilized storage, track optimization progress, and generate reports that demonstrate environmental impact reduction. The CSV export functionality enables integration with business intelligence tools for executive sustainability reporting.

```bash
# Create analytics bucket for Storage Lens reports
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket $ANALYTICS_BUCKET \
	--region $AWS_REGION

# Configure Storage Lens for sustainability metrics
cat > storage-lens-config.json << EOF
{
	"Id": "SustainabilityMetrics",
	"AccountLevel": {
		"ActivityMetrics": {
			"IsEnabled": true
		},
		"BucketLevel": {
			"ActivityMetrics": {
				"IsEnabled": true
			},
			"PrefixLevel": {
				"StorageMetrics": {
					"IsEnabled": true
				}
			}
		}
	},
	"Include": {
		"Buckets": [
			"arn:aws:s3:::$ARCHIVE_BUCKET"
		]
	},
	"DataExport": {
		"S3BucketDestination": {
			"OutputSchemaVersion": "V_1",
			"AccountId": "$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID",
			"Arn": "arn:aws:s3:::$ANALYTICS_BUCKET",
			"Format": "CSV",
			"Prefix": "storage-lens-reports/"
		}
	},
	"IsEnabled": true
}
EOF

aws s3control put-storage-lens-configuration \
	--account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID \
	--config-id SustainabilityMetrics \
	--storage-lens-configuration file://storage-lens-config.json

echo "✅ S3 Storage Lens configured for sustainability tracking"
```

   Storage Lens is now actively monitoring the archive bucket and will generate daily reports showing storage optimization opportunities, cost trends, and sustainability metrics. These reports provide the data foundation for demonstrating ROI on sustainability initiatives and identifying additional optimization opportunities across the organization.

6. **Create IAM Role for Sustainability Monitoring Lambda**:

   The Lambda function requires specific IAM permissions to read bucket configurations, access CloudWatch metrics, and publish sustainability data. Following the principle of least privilege, this role grants only the minimum permissions necessary for sustainability monitoring while maintaining security. The role enables automated carbon footprint calculations and cost optimization recommendations without compromising data security or compliance requirements.

```bash
# Create IAM role for Lambda
cat > lambda-trust-policy.json << EOF
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
			},
			"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
		}
	]
}
EOF

LAMBDA_ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam create-role \
	--role-name SustainabilityMonitorRole \
	--assume-role-policy-document file://lambda-trust-policy.json \
	--query 'Role.Arn' --output text)

# Create permissions policy
cat > lambda-permissions.json << EOF
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"logs:CreateLogGroup",
				"logs:CreateLogStream",
				"logs:PutLogEvents",
				"s3:GetBucketTagging",
				"s3:GetBucketLocation",
				"s3:ListBucket",
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:GetStorageLensConfiguration",
				"s3:ListStorageLensConfigurations",
				"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
				"cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
				"cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
				"sns:Publish"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
EOF

aws iam put-role-policy \
	--role-name SustainabilityMonitorRole \
	--policy-name SustainabilityPermissions \
	--policy-document file://lambda-permissions.json

export LAMBDA_ROLE_ARN
echo "✅ Lambda IAM role created"
```

   The IAM role now provides the Lambda function with secure, time-limited access to necessary AWS services. This role enables the sustainability monitoring function to calculate carbon footprint reductions, track storage efficiency metrics, and generate recommendations while adhering to enterprise security standards.

7. **Deploy Advanced Sustainability Monitoring Lambda Function**:

   This Lambda function implements sophisticated carbon footprint calculations based on AWS's published sustainability metrics and estimated energy consumption patterns across different storage tiers. The function analyzes storage distribution, calculates environmental impact reductions, and generates actionable recommendations for further optimization. By automating these calculations, organizations can track sustainability progress and demonstrate environmental ROI of their cloud optimization initiatives.

```bash
# Create Lambda function code
cat > sustainability_monitor.py << 'EOF'
import json
import boto3
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from decimal import Decimal

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    try:
        # Get bucket tagging to identify sustainability goals
        tags_response = s3.get_bucket_tagging(Bucket=bucket_name)
        tags = {tag['Key']: tag['Value'] for tag in tags_response['TagSet']}
        
        # Calculate storage metrics
        storage_metrics = calculate_storage_efficiency(s3, bucket_name)
        
        # Estimate carbon footprint reduction
        carbon_metrics = calculate_carbon_impact(storage_metrics)
        
        # Publish custom CloudWatch metrics
        publish_sustainability_metrics(cloudwatch, storage_metrics, carbon_metrics)

   The sustainability monitoring function is now active and ready to analyze storage patterns, calculate carbon footprint reductions, and generate comprehensive sustainability reports. This automated monitoring eliminates manual tracking overhead while providing accurate, real-time insights into environmental impact and cost optimization opportunities.

8. **Create CloudWatch Dashboard for Executive Sustainability Reporting**:

   CloudWatch dashboards provide real-time visualization of sustainability metrics that are essential for executive reporting and compliance documentation. The dashboard displays total storage usage, estimated carbon footprint, and percentage reduction in environmental impact, enabling stakeholders to monitor progress toward sustainability goals. These visualizations support ESG reporting requirements and demonstrate the business value of cloud optimization initiatives.

```bash
# Create CloudWatch dashboard
cat > dashboard-config.json << EOF
{
	"widgets": [
		{
			"type": "metric",
			"x": 0,
			"y": 0,
			"width": 12,
			"height": 6,
			"properties": {
				"metrics": [
					["SustainableArchive", "TotalStorageGB"],
					[".", "EstimatedMonthlyCarbonKg"]
				],
				"period": 3600,
				"stat": "Average",
				"region": "$AWS_REGION",
				"title": "Storage & Carbon Metrics"
			}
		},

			"properties": {
				"metrics": [
					["SustainableArchive", "CarbonReductionPercentage"]
				],
				"period": 3600,
				"stat": "Average",
				"region": "$AWS_REGION",
				"title": "Carbon Footprint Reduction"
			}
		}
	]
}
EOF

aws cloudwatch put-dashboard \
	--dashboard-name "SustainableArchive" \
	--dashboard-body file://dashboard-config.json

echo "✅ CloudWatch dashboard created for sustainability tracking"
```

   The sustainability dashboard is now available in CloudWatch, providing real-time visibility into environmental impact metrics and cost optimization progress. Executive stakeholders can use these visualizations to track sustainability KPIs, demonstrate ESG compliance, and make data-driven decisions about cloud infrastructure investments.

9. **Implement Automated Monitoring and Create Test Data for Validation**:

   EventBridge scheduling enables continuous sustainability monitoring without operational overhead, ensuring that carbon footprint calculations and optimization recommendations are always current. The automated daily execution provides consistent tracking of environmental impact trends and identifies optimization opportunities as they emerge. Sample data with varied access patterns demonstrates the intelligent tiering capabilities and provides immediate validation of the sustainability monitoring system.

```bash
# Create EventBridge rule for daily monitoring
aws events put-rule \
	--name sustainability-daily-check \
	--schedule-expression "rate(1 day)" \
	--description "Daily sustainability metrics collection"

# Add Lambda permission
aws lambda add-permission \
	--function-name sustainability-archive-monitor \
	--statement-id allow-eventbridge-daily \
	--action lambda:InvokeFunction \
	--principal events.amazonaws.com

# Add Lambda as target
aws events put-targets \
	--rule sustainability-daily-check \
	--targets "Id"="1","Arn"="$LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN"

# Create sample data for testing
mkdir -p test-data

# Create different types of files to demonstrate tiering
echo "Frequently accessed application data" > test-data/frequent-data.txt
echo "Document archive from 2023" > test-data/archive-doc-2023.pdf
echo "Long-term backup data" > test-data/long-term/backup-data.zip

# Upload sample data with different prefixes
aws s3 cp test-data/frequent-data.txt s3://$ARCHIVE_BUCKET/active/
aws s3 cp test-data/archive-doc-2023.pdf s3://$ARCHIVE_BUCKET/documents/
aws s3 cp test-data/long-term/backup-data.zip s3://$ARCHIVE_BUCKET/long-term/

echo "✅ Scheduled monitoring and sample data created"
```

   The automated monitoring system is now operational and will execute daily sustainability analysis. The sample data provides different access patterns that will demonstrate intelligent tiering behavior over time, allowing you to observe cost optimization and environmental impact reduction as objects automatically transition between storage tiers based on actual usage patterns.

## Validation & Testing

1. Verify Intelligent-Tiering configuration is active:

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration \
	--bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--id SustainableArchiveConfig \
	--query 'IntelligentTieringConfiguration.[Id,Status]' \
	--output table
```

Expected output:
```
-----------------------------------------
|GetBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration|
+------------------------+---------------+
|  SustainableArchiveConfig|   Enabled     |

```

2. Check lifecycle policy configuration:

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
	--bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--query 'Rules[*].[ID,Status]' \
	--output table
```

3. Test sustainability monitoring function:

```bash
aws lambda invoke \
	--function-name sustainability-archive-monitor \
	--payload '{}' \
	sustainability-response.json

echo "Lambda Response:"
cat sustainability-response.json | jq '.body | fromjson'
```

4. Verify CloudWatch metrics are being published:

```bash
# Wait a few minutes after running the Lambda, then check metrics
aws cloudwatch list-metrics \
	--namespace SustainableArchive \
	--query 'Metrics[*].MetricName' \
	--output table
```

5. Monitor storage class transitions over time:

```bash
# Check object storage classes (may take time to transition)
aws s3api list-objects-v2 \
	--bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET \
	--query 'Contents[*].[Key,StorageClass,Size]' \
	--output table
```

> **Warning**: S3 Intelligent-Tiering transitions occur automatically but may take 24-48 hours to show initial effects. Plan validation testing accordingly and use S3 Storage Lens reports for comprehensive analysis of storage patterns and cost optimization opportunities.

> **Tip**: Monitor the sustainability dashboard regularly to track progress toward environmental goals. The carbon footprint calculations provide estimates based on AWS published data and can help demonstrate ROI on sustainability initiatives to executive stakeholders.

## Cleanup

1. Delete sample data and Lambda function:

```bash
# Empty the archive bucket
aws s3 rm s3://$ARCHIVE_BUCKET --recursive

# Delete Lambda function
aws lambda delete-function --function-name sustainability-archive-monitor

# Delete EventBridge rule
aws events remove-targets --rule sustainability-daily-check --ids "1"
aws events delete-rule --rule sustainability-daily-check
```

2. Remove IAM roles and policies:

```bash
# Delete Lambda IAM role
aws iam delete-role-policy \
	--role-name SustainabilityMonitorRole \
	--policy-name SustainabilityPermissions
aws iam delete-role --role-name SustainabilityMonitorRole
```

3. Delete S3 buckets and configurations:

```bash
# Remove Storage Lens configuration
aws s3control delete-storage-lens-configuration \
	--account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID \
	--config-id SustainabilityMetrics

# Empty and delete analytics bucket
aws s3 rm s3://$ANALYTICS_BUCKET --recursive
aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket $ANALYTICS_BUCKET

# Delete archive bucket
aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket $ARCHIVE_BUCKET
```

4. Clean up CloudWatch and local files:

```bash
# Delete CloudWatch dashboard
aws cloudwatch delete-dashboards \
	--dashboard-names SustainableArchive

# Clean up local files
rm -f lifecycle-policy.json storage-lens-config.json
rm -f lambda-trust-policy.json lambda-permissions.json
rm -f dashboard-config.json sustainability-monitor.zip
rm -f sustainability_monitor.py sustainability-response.json
rm -rf test-data/
```

## Discussion

[S3 Intelligent-Tiering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intelligent-tiering.html) represents a paradigm shift from traditional static storage class assignments to dynamic, access-pattern-based optimization. This storage class automatically moves objects between access tiers based on changing access patterns, eliminating the guesswork traditionally required for cost optimization. The service monitors access patterns and moves objects that haven't been accessed for 30 consecutive days to a lower-cost Infrequent Access tier, and after 90 days of no access to the Archive Instant Access tier.

For organizations with sustainability initiatives, this recipe demonstrates how cloud storage optimization directly contributes to environmental goals. By automatically moving data to more energy-efficient storage tiers, organizations can reduce their carbon footprint while optimizing costs. AWS data centers are designed for high efficiency, and archived data requires significantly less energy for maintenance than actively accessed storage. [AWS Sustainability](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/the-cloud) initiatives show that the cloud can be up to five times more carbon efficient than traditional on-premises environments.

The integration of S3 Storage Lens provides comprehensive analytics that help organizations understand their storage usage patterns and identify optimization opportunities. Storage Lens metrics can reveal unused storage, duplicate data, and inefficient storage class usage patterns. The custom Lambda monitoring function extends these capabilities by calculating estimated carbon footprint reductions and providing actionable recommendations for further optimization. This approach transforms storage management from reactive cost control to proactive sustainability management.

## Challenge

Extend this solution by implementing multi-region sustainability reporting that compares carbon footprints across different AWS regions based on their renewable energy usage. Create a comprehensive sustainability dashboard that tracks not only storage optimization but also data transfer patterns, regional energy sources, and provides recommendations for reducing the overall environmental impact of your data architecture. Additionally, implement automated policies that can move data to regions with higher renewable energy percentages based on your organization's sustainability commitments and data residency requirements.
