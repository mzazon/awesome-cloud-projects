# Example Terraform variables file for simple-environment-health-check-ssm-sns
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your values

# ===========================================
# REQUIRED VARIABLES
# ===========================================

# Email address to receive health check notifications
# This email will receive SNS notifications when health issues are detected
notification_email = "your-email@example.com"

# ===========================================
# OPTIONAL VARIABLES (with defaults)
# ===========================================

# AWS region for resource deployment
# Choose a region close to your resources for better performance
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Environment tag for resources (affects resource naming and tagging)
# Valid values: dev, staging, prod
environment = "dev"

# Project name (used for resource naming and identification)
# Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
project_name = "environment-health-check"

# ===========================================
# MONITORING CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================

# Schedule expression for health checks
# Examples:
#   - "rate(1 minute)"     # Every minute (for testing)
#   - "rate(5 minutes)"    # Every 5 minutes (recommended)
#   - "rate(15 minutes)"   # Every 15 minutes (less frequent)
#   - "rate(1 hour)"       # Every hour (minimal monitoring)
#   - "cron(0 9 * * ? *)"  # Daily at 9 AM UTC
health_check_schedule = "rate(5 minutes)"

# Custom compliance type for health monitoring
# You can customize this to match your organization's compliance standards
compliance_type = "Custom:EnvironmentHealth"

# ===========================================
# LAMBDA FUNCTION CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================

# Lambda function timeout in seconds (30-900)
# Increase if you have many instances to check
lambda_timeout = 60

# Lambda function memory allocation in MB (128-10240)
# Higher memory may improve performance for large environments
lambda_memory_size = 256

# ===========================================
# RESOURCE NAMING
# ===========================================

# Length of random suffix for resource names (4-12 characters)
# Helps ensure unique resource names across deployments
random_suffix_length = 6

# ===========================================
# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS FOR DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS
# ===========================================

# Development Environment Example:
# notification_email = "dev-team@company.com"
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# environment = "dev"
# health_check_schedule = "rate(15 minutes)"
# lambda_timeout = 30

# Production Environment Example:
# notification_email = "ops-team@company.com"
# aws_region = "us-west-2"
# environment = "prod"
# health_check_schedule = "rate(5 minutes)"
# lambda_timeout = 120
# lambda_memory_size = 512

# Testing Environment Example:
# notification_email = "test-alerts@company.com"
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# environment = "staging"
# health_check_schedule = "rate(1 minute)"
# lambda_timeout = 30
# random_suffix_length = 8
