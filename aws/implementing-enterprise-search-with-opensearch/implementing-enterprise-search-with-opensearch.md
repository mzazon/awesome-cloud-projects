## Prerequisites

1. AWS account with OpenSearch Service, Lambda, Kinesis, S3, Glue, and IAM permissions
2. AWS CLI v2 installed and configured (or AWS CloudShell)
3. Advanced knowledge of distributed search systems, JSON document structures, and REST APIs
4. Understanding of search concepts (indexing, mapping, queries, analyzers, aggregations)
5. Experience with data pipeline architectures and ETL processes
6. Familiarity with monitoring and performance optimization techniques
7. Estimated cost: $200-500/month for production-ready environment (m6g.large.search instances with dedicated masters, 100GB storage, and multi-AZ deployment)

> **Note**: OpenSearch Service charges are based on instance hours, storage, and data transfer. Use development instance types to minimize costs during testing.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables
export AWS_REGION=$(aws configure get region)
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity \
    --query Account --output text)

# Generate unique identifiers for resources
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(aws secretsmanager get-random-password \
    --exclude-punctuation --exclude-uppercase \
    --password-length 6 --require-each-included-type \
    --output text --query RandomPassword)

export DOMAIN_NAME="search-demo-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export S3_BUCKET_NAME="opensearch-data-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME="opensearch-indexer-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

echo "Domain Name: $DOMAIN_NAME"
echo "S3 Bucket: $S3_BUCKET_NAME"
echo "Lambda Function: $LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME"

# Create S3 bucket for sample data
aws s3 mb s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME --region $AWS_REGION

echo "✅ Environment variables set and S3 bucket created"
```

## Steps

1. **Create IAM role for OpenSearch Service access**:

   IAM roles provide secure, temporary credential delegation that enables AWS services to interact with each other without hardcoding access keys. For OpenSearch Service, proper IAM configuration is essential for security, compliance, and operational excellence following the [AWS Security Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html). This role establishes the security foundation that enables fine-grained access controls and integrates with your existing identity management strategy.

   ```bash
   # Create trust policy for OpenSearch Service
   cat > opensearch-trust-policy.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "opensearch.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF
   
   # Create the IAM role
   aws iam create-role \
       --role-name OpenSearchServiceRole-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
       --assume-role-policy-document file://opensearch-trust-policy.json
   
   # Store role ARN for later use
   export OS_ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam get-role \
       --role-name OpenSearchServiceRole-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
       --query 'Role.Arn' --output text)
   
   echo "✅ Created IAM role: $OS_ROLE_ARN"
   ```

   The IAM role is now established with the proper trust relationship, enabling OpenSearch Service to assume this role when needed. This security foundation supports principle of least privilege and prepares your environment for advanced access control configurations. The role ARN will be used in subsequent steps to configure domain-level permissions and integrate with other AWS services.

2. **Create OpenSearch Service domain**:

   OpenSearch Service requires log groups to be created before enabling logging. We're creating a production-ready domain with dedicated master nodes for cluster management, which provides better stability and performance isolation from data nodes following AWS Well-Architected [Reliability Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html) principles.

   ```bash
   # Create CloudWatch log groups for OpenSearch logs
   aws logs create-log-group \
       --log-group-name /aws/opensearch/domains/${DOMAIN_NAME}/index-slow-logs \
       --region $AWS_REGION
   
   aws logs create-log-group \
       --log-group-name /aws/opensearch/domains/${DOMAIN_NAME}/search-slow-logs \
       --region $AWS_REGION
   
   # Create domain configuration
   cat > domain-config.json << EOF
   {
     "DomainName": "${DOMAIN_NAME}",
     "OpenSearchVersion": "OpenSearch_2.15",
     "ClusterConfig": {
       "InstanceType": "m6g.large.search",
       "InstanceCount": 3,
       "DedicatedMasterEnabled": true,
       "DedicatedMasterType": "m6g.medium.search",
       "DedicatedMasterCount": 3,
       "ZoneAwarenessEnabled": true,
       "ZoneAwarenessConfig": {
         "AvailabilityZoneCount": 3
       },
       "WarmEnabled": false
     },
     "EBSOptions": {

       "Throughput": 125
     },
     "AccessPolicies": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"*\"},\"Action\":\"es:*\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:es:${AWS_REGION}:${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:domain/${DOMAIN_NAME}/*\"}]}",
     "EncryptionAtRestOptions": {
       "Enabled": true
     },
     "NodeToNodeEncryptionOptions": {
       "Enabled": true
     },
     "DomainEndpointOptions": {
       "EnforceHTTPS": true,
       "TLSSecurityPolicy": "Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-2019-07"
     },
     "AdvancedSecurityOptions": {
       "Enabled": true,
       "InternalUserDatabaseEnabled": true,
       "MasterUserOptions": {
         "MasterUserName": "admin",
         "MasterUserPassword": "TempPassword123!"
       }
     },
     "LogPublishingOptions": {
       "INDEX_SLOW_LOGS": {
         "CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn": "arn:aws:logs:${AWS_REGION}:${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:log-group:/aws/opensearch/domains/${DOMAIN_NAME}/index-slow-logs",
         "Enabled": true
       },
       "SEARCH_SLOW_LOGS": {
         "CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn": "arn:aws:logs:${AWS_REGION}:${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:log-group:/aws/opensearch/domains/${DOMAIN_NAME}/search-slow-logs",
         "Enabled": true
       }
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   # Create the OpenSearch domain
   aws opensearch create-domain \
       --cli-input-json file://domain-config.json
   
   echo "✅ OpenSearch domain creation initiated (this takes 20-30 minutes for multi-AZ with dedicated masters)"
   ```

   The OpenSearch domain creation process is now underway. This multi-AZ configuration with dedicated master nodes provides enterprise-grade availability and performance isolation. The dedicated masters handle cluster management operations while data nodes focus exclusively on indexing and search workloads, ensuring optimal performance under varying load conditions. The domain configuration includes comprehensive security features that establish a secure foundation for your search infrastructure.

   > **Warning**: OpenSearch domain creation is a time-intensive process. Multi-AZ deployments with dedicated masters typically take 20-30 minutes to complete. Monitor the [OpenSearch Service documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createupdatedomains.html) for best practices on domain configuration.

3. **Wait for domain to be available and get endpoint**:

   Domain availability verification ensures that all cluster components are fully operational before proceeding with data operations. The endpoint provides the access point for all OpenSearch REST API operations including indexing, searching, and cluster management. Proper endpoint configuration is critical for establishing secure connections and enabling application integration with your search infrastructure.

   ```bash
   # Wait for domain to become available
   echo "Waiting for OpenSearch domain to be available..."
   aws opensearch wait domain-available --domain-name $DOMAIN_NAME
   
   # Get domain endpoint
   export OS_ENDPOINT=$(aws opensearch describe-domain \
       --domain-name $DOMAIN_NAME \
       --query 'DomainStatus.Endpoint' --output text)
   
   echo "✅ OpenSearch domain available at: https://$OS_ENDPOINT"
   ```

   The OpenSearch domain is now fully operational and ready to accept data operations. The endpoint URL provides secure HTTPS access to the cluster and will be used for all subsequent API calls. This marks the completion of the infrastructure provisioning phase and enables the transition to data configuration and indexing operations.

4. **Create sample product data for indexing**:

   Sample data creation establishes a realistic dataset that demonstrates OpenSearch capabilities across diverse product categories and data types. This structured JSON data includes various field types (text, numeric, date, keyword arrays) that showcase different search and analytics patterns. The data design reflects real-world e-commerce scenarios and enables testing of complex search features including faceted search, price filtering, and multi-field queries.

   ```bash
   # Create sample product data
   cat > sample-products.json << 'EOF'

   ]
   EOF
   
   # Upload sample data to S3
   aws s3 cp sample-products.json s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/
   
   echo "✅ Sample product data created and uploaded to S3"
   ```

   The sample dataset is now available in S3 and ready for indexing operations. This diverse product catalog provides the foundation for demonstrating search capabilities including full-text search, faceted navigation, price range filtering, and category-based aggregations. The data structure supports advanced search patterns and analytics that are essential for building sophisticated search applications.

5. **Create index mapping for optimal search performance**:

   Index mappings define how documents and their fields are stored and indexed in OpenSearch. Proper mapping configuration is crucial for search performance and functionality following AWS [Performance Efficiency Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/performance-efficiency-pillar/welcome.html) principles. We're using both `text` and `keyword` field types - `text` for full-text search and `keyword` for exact matches, aggregations, and sorting.

   ```bash
   # Create index mapping for products
   cat > product-mapping.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "mappings": {
       "properties": {
         "id": {"type": "keyword"},
         "title": {
           "type": "text",
           "analyzer": "standard",
           "fields": {
             "keyword": {"type": "keyword"}
           }
         },
         "description": {
           "type": "text",
           "analyzer": "standard"
         },
         "category": {"type": "keyword"},
         "brand": {"type": "keyword"},
         "price": {"type": "float"},
         "rating": {"type": "float"},
         "tags": {"type": "keyword"},
         "stock": {"type": "integer"},
         "created_date": {"type": "date", "format": "yyyy-MM-dd"}
       }
     },
     "settings": {
       "number_of_shards": 1,
       "number_of_replicas": 0,
       "analysis": {
         "analyzer": {
           "custom_search_analyzer": {
             "type": "custom",
             "tokenizer": "standard",
             "filter": ["lowercase", "stop"]
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   # Create the products index with mapping
   curl -X PUT "https://$OS_ENDPOINT/products" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -u admin:TempPassword123! \
       -d @product-mapping.json
   
   echo "✅ Created products index with optimized mapping"
   ```

   The index mapping is now configured to optimize search performance and enable advanced query capabilities. The dual-field approach (text and keyword) provides flexibility for both full-text search and exact matching operations. Custom analyzers and field configurations ensure optimal tokenization and relevance scoring for your specific use case. This foundation enables sophisticated search features including faceted navigation, sorting, and aggregations.

   > **Tip**: Consider using [OpenSearch index templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managing-indices.html#index-templates) for dynamic mapping when dealing with varying document structures across multiple indices.

6. **Index sample products into OpenSearch**:

   Document indexing transforms raw data into searchable, structured content within OpenSearch. Each document is assigned a unique identifier and processed according to the mapping configuration established in the previous step. The indexing process includes field analysis, tokenization, and storage optimization that enables fast retrieval and relevance scoring. This step demonstrates the document ingestion workflow that forms the core of any search application.

   ```bash
   # Index each product document
   curl -X POST "https://$OS_ENDPOINT/products/_doc/prod-001" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -u admin:TempPassword123! \
       -d '{
         "id": "prod-001",
         "title": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
         "description": "High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation and 30-hour battery life",
         "category": "Electronics",
         "brand": "TechSound",
         "price": 199.99,
         "rating": 4.5,
         "tags": ["wireless", "bluetooth", "noise-cancelling", "headphones"],
         "stock": 150,
         "created_date": "2024-01-15"
       }'
   
   curl -X POST "https://$OS_ENDPOINT/products/_doc/prod-002" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -u admin:TempPassword123! \
       -d '{
         "id": "prod-002",
         "title": "Organic Cotton T-Shirt",
         "description": "Comfortable organic cotton t-shirt available in multiple colors and sizes",
         "category": "Clothing", 
         "brand": "EcoWear",
         "price": 29.99,
         "rating": 4.2,
         "tags": ["organic", "cotton", "t-shirt", "eco-friendly"],
         "stock": 75,
         "created_date": "2024-01-10"
       }'
   
   curl -X POST "https://$OS_ENDPOINT/products/_doc/prod-003" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -u admin:TempPassword123! \
       -d '{
         "id": "prod-003",
         "title": "Smart Fitness Watch",
         "description": "Advanced fitness tracking watch with heart rate monitor and GPS",
         "category": "Electronics",
         "brand": "FitTech", 
         "price": 299.99,
         "rating": 4.7,
         "tags": ["smartwatch", "fitness", "GPS", "heart-rate"],
         "stock": 89,
         "created_date": "2024-01-12"
       }'
   
   # Refresh index to make documents searchable
   curl -X POST "https://$OS_ENDPOINT/products/_refresh" \
       -u admin:TempPassword123!
   
   echo "✅ Indexed sample products into OpenSearch"
   ```

   The product documents are now indexed and immediately available for search operations. The refresh operation ensures that all documents are committed to searchable storage and visible to query operations. This completes the data ingestion phase and establishes a functional search index that demonstrates real-world search scenarios including product discovery, category filtering, and price-based searches.

7. **Create Lambda function for automated data indexing**:

   Automated indexing through Lambda functions enables real-time data processing and keeps your search index synchronized with changing data sources. This serverless approach provides cost-effective, event-driven indexing that scales automatically with data volume following AWS [Cost Optimization Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/welcome.html) principles. The Lambda function demonstrates integration patterns for S3-triggered indexing workflows that are essential for maintaining current search results in dynamic environments.

   ```bash
   # Create Lambda function code with authentication
   cat > lambda-indexer.py << 'EOF'
   import json
   import boto3
   import requests
   from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
   import os
   
   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       # OpenSearch endpoint and credentials from environment variables
       os_endpoint = os.environ['OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT']
       username = os.environ.get('OPENSEARCH_USERNAME', 'admin')
       password = os.environ.get('OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD', 'TempPassword123!')
       
       # Process S3 event (if triggered by S3)
       if 'Records' in event:
           s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
           
           for record in event['Records']:
               bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
               key = record['s3']['object']['key']
               
               # Download file from S3
               response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
               content = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')
               
               # Parse JSON data
               products = json.loads(content)
               
               # Index each product with authentication
               for product in products:
                   doc_id = product['id']
                   index_url = f"https://{os_endpoint}/products/_doc/{doc_id}"
                   
                   response = requests.put(
                       index_url,
                       headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
                       auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password),

The architecture supports horizontal scaling to handle increasing data volumes and query loads while maintaining consistent performance. Advanced query optimization techniques leverage OpenSearch's distributed computing capabilities for complex aggregations and real-time analytics.

The implementation follows AWS Well-Architected Framework principles including the [Security Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html) with encryption at rest and in transit, the [Reliability Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html) with multi-AZ deployment, and the [Performance Efficiency Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/performance-efficiency-pillar/welcome.html) with dedicated master nodes and optimized storage configurations. Integration with AWS services creates a comprehensive data pipeline that automatically processes, indexes, and analyzes large-scale datasets.

> **Tip**: Use OpenSearch ML plugins to implement semantic search capabilities with vector embeddings for more intelligent and context-aware search results. Reference the [OpenSearch ML documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ml.html) for implementation guidance.
