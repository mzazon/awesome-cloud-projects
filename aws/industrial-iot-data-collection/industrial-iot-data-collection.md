# Verify IoT SiteWise is available in region
aws iotsitewise describe-default-encryption-configuration \
    --region ${AWS_REGION}

echo "✅ Environment prepared for industrial IoT setup"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Industrial Asset Model**:

   Asset models in IoT SiteWise define the structure and relationships of industrial equipment, enabling standardized data collection across different manufacturers and protocols. This foundational step establishes the data schema that will organize all sensor readings, calculated metrics, and equipment hierarchies in your industrial environment.

   ```bash
   # Create asset model for manufacturing equipment
   ASSET_MODEL_ID=$(aws iotsitewise create-asset-model \
       --asset-model-name "ProductionLineEquipment" \
       --asset-model-description "Model for production line machinery" \
       --asset-model-properties '[
           {
               "name": "Temperature",
               "dataType": "DOUBLE",
               "unit": "Celsius",
               "type": {
                   "measurement": {}
               }
           },
           {
               "name": "Pressure",
               "dataType": "DOUBLE", 
               "unit": "PSI",
               "type": {
                   "measurement": {}
               }
           },
           {
               "name": "OperationalEfficiency",
               "dataType": "DOUBLE",
               "unit": "Percent",
               "type": {
                   "transform": {
                       "expression": "temp / 100 * pressure / 50",
                       "variables": [
                           {
                               "name": "temp",
                               "value": {
                                   "propertyId": "Temperature"
                               }
                           },
                           {
                               "name": "pressure", 
                               "value": {
                                   "propertyId": "Pressure"
                               }
                           }
                       ]
                   }
               }
           }
       ]' \
       --query 'assetModelId' --output text)
   
   echo "✅ Asset model created: ${ASSET_MODEL_ID}"
   ```

   The asset model now provides a reusable template that standardizes how equipment data is structured and processed. This enables consistent data collection across multiple devices and supports calculated metrics that derive business insights from raw sensor data.

2. **Create Physical Asset Instance**:

   Physical assets represent actual equipment in your manufacturing facility, providing the connection point between your asset model and real-world devices. This step creates the digital twin that will receive and process data from industrial sensors and control systems.

   ```bash
   # Create asset instance representing actual equipment
   ASSET_ID=$(aws iotsitewise create-asset \
       --asset-name "ProductionLine-A-Pump-001" \
       --asset-model-id ${ASSET_MODEL_ID} \
       --query 'assetId' --output text)
   
   # Wait for asset to be active
   aws iotsitewise wait asset-active \
       --asset-id ${ASSET_ID}
   
   echo "✅ Physical asset created: ${ASSET_ID}"
   ```

   Your digital asset is now established and ready to receive data streams from connected industrial equipment. This asset instance will serve as the central point for all data collection, processing, and analysis for this specific piece of equipment.

3. **Configure Timestream Database for Time-Series Storage**:

   Amazon Timestream provides purpose-built time-series database capabilities optimized for IoT workloads, offering automatic data lifecycle management and high-performance queries for industrial analytics. Integrating Timestream with SiteWise enables long-term storage and advanced analytics on historical equipment data.

   ```bash
   # Create Timestream database for industrial data
   aws timestream-write create-database \
       --database-name ${TIMESTREAM_DB_NAME}
   
   # Create table for SiteWise data
   aws timestream-write create-table \
       --database-name ${TIMESTREAM_DB_NAME} \
       --table-name "equipment-metrics" \
       --retention-properties '{
           "MemoryStoreRetentionPeriodInHours": 24,
           "MagneticStoreRetentionPeriodInDays": 365
       }'
   
   echo "✅ Timestream database configured for time-series storage"
   ```

   Timestream is now configured to automatically manage data lifecycle, keeping recent data in high-performance memory storage while transitioning older data to cost-effective magnetic storage. This provides optimal query performance for real-time analytics while maintaining cost efficiency for historical data retention.

4. **Set Up IoT SiteWise Gateway Simulation**:

   The IoT SiteWise gateway acts as the bridge between industrial protocols and AWS cloud services, handling data collection, preprocessing, and secure transmission. Since we're using simulated data, this step creates the gateway configuration that would typically connect to your industrial network infrastructure.

   ```bash
   # Create gateway capability configuration
   GATEWAY_ID=$(aws iotsitewise create-gateway \
       --gateway-name "manufacturing-gateway-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --gateway-platform '{
           "greengrass": {
               "groupArn": "arn:aws:greengrass:'${AWS_REGION}':'${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}':groups/simulation-group"
           }
       }' \
       --tags "Environment=Development,Project=${SITEWISE_PROJECT_NAME}" \
       --query 'gatewayId' --output text)
   
   echo "✅ Gateway configuration established: ${GATEWAY_ID}"
   ```

   The gateway is now configured to handle industrial data collection protocols and manage the secure connection between your factory floor and AWS cloud services. In production environments, this gateway would be deployed on industrial-grade hardware within your manufacturing facility.

5. **Configure Data Ingestion and Measurements**:

   Data ingestion establishes the flow of sensor readings from industrial equipment into SiteWise, enabling real-time monitoring and historical analysis. This configuration defines how raw measurements are processed, validated, and stored within your industrial data platform.

   ```bash
   # Get property IDs for measurements
   TEMP_PROPERTY_ID=$(aws iotsitewise describe-asset \
       --asset-id ${ASSET_ID} \
       --query 'assetProperties[?name==`Temperature`].id' \
       --output text)
   
   PRESSURE_PROPERTY_ID=$(aws iotsitewise describe-asset \
       --asset-id ${ASSET_ID} \
       --query 'assetProperties[?name==`Pressure`].id' \
       --output text)
   
   # Simulate batch data ingestion
   aws iotsitewise batch-put-asset-property-value \
       --entries '[
           {
               "entryId": "temp-reading-1",
               "assetId": "'${ASSET_ID}'",
               "propertyId": "'${TEMP_PROPERTY_ID}'",
               "propertyValues": [
                   {
                       "value": {
                           "doubleValue": 75.5
                       },
                       "timestamp": {
                           "timeInSeconds": '$(date +%s)'
                       }
                   }
               ]
           },
           {
               "entryId": "pressure-reading-1", 
               "assetId": "'${ASSET_ID}'",
               "propertyId": "'${PRESSURE_PROPERTY_ID}'",
               "propertyValues": [
                   {
                       "value": {
                           "doubleValue": 45.2
                       },
                       "timestamp": {
                           "timeInSeconds": '$(date +%s)'
                       }
                   }
               ]
           }
       ]'
   
   echo "✅ Industrial measurements ingested successfully"
   ```

   Your industrial data is now flowing into SiteWise where it's automatically processed, validated, and made available for real-time monitoring and historical analysis. The system will continue processing incoming measurements and calculating derived metrics based on your asset model configuration.

6. **Configure CloudWatch Monitoring for Equipment**:

   CloudWatch integration provides comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities for industrial equipment, enabling proactive maintenance and operational optimization. This monitoring layer ensures you can quickly identify equipment anomalies and performance degradation before they impact production.

   ```bash
   # Create CloudWatch alarm for temperature threshold
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
       --alarm-name "ProductionLine-A-HighTemperature" \
       --alarm-description "Alert when equipment temperature exceeds threshold" \
       --metric-name "Temperature" \
       --namespace "AWS/IoTSiteWise" \
       --statistic "Average" \
       --period 300 \
       --threshold 80.0 \
       --comparison-operator "GreaterThanThreshold" \
       --evaluation-periods 2 \
       --dimensions "Name=AssetId,Value=${ASSET_ID}"
   
   # Create custom metric for operational efficiency tracking
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
       --namespace "Manufacturing/Efficiency" \
       --metric-data '[
           {
               "MetricName": "OperationalEfficiency",
               "Value": 85.5,
               "Unit": "Percent",
               "Dimensions": [
                   {
                       "Name": "AssetId",
                       "Value": "'${ASSET_ID}'"
                   }
               ]
           }
       ]'
   
   echo "✅ Equipment monitoring and alerting configured"
   ```

   CloudWatch monitoring is now actively tracking your equipment performance with automated alerting for critical thresholds. This monitoring foundation enables predictive maintenance strategies and ensures rapid response to equipment anomalies that could affect production schedules.

> **Warning**: In production environments, ensure proper security configurations including VPC endpoints, device certificates, and least-privilege IAM policies to protect industrial control systems from cyber threats.
