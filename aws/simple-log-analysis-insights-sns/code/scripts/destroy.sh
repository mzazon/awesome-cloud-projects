Destroy script for Simple Log Analysis with CloudWatch Insights and SNS

Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]

Options:
    -f, --force            Skip confirmation prompts (use with caution)
    -k, --keep-logs        Keep CloudWatch log group and data
    -v, --verbose          Enable verbose logging
    -s, --state-file FILE  Custom deployment state file path
    -h, --help             Show this help message

Example:
    $0                     # Interactive cleanup with confirmations
    $0 --force             # Automatic cleanup without prompts
    $0 --keep-logs         # Cleanup but preserve log data

WARNING: This will permanently delete all resources created by the deployment.
Make sure you have backed up any important log data before proceeding.
