# VPC Lattice Cost Analytics - Terraform Variables Example
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values for your environment

# Project Configuration
project_name = "lattice-cost-analytics"
environment  = "demo"
cost_center  = "engineering"
owner        = "platform-team"

# Lambda Function Configuration
lambda_timeout     = 300          # 5 minutes
lambda_memory_size = 512          # 512 MB
lambda_runtime     = "python3.11" # Latest supported Python runtime

# Cost Analysis Scheduling
# Options: rate(X minutes|hours|days) or cron expressions
cost_analysis_schedule = "rate(1 day)"

# Feature Toggles
enable_cloudwatch_dashboard = true  # Create CloudWatch dashboard for visualization
enable_demo_vpc_lattice     = true  # Deploy demo VPC Lattice resources for testing
s3_versioning_enabled       = true  # Enable S3 bucket versioning for data protection
s3_encryption_enabled       = true  # Enable S3 server-side encryption

# Common Tags (applied to all resources)
common_tags = {
  Project     = "lattice-cost-analytics"
  Environment = "demo"
  CostCenter  = "engineering"
  Owner       = "platform-team"
  ServiceMesh = "vpc-lattice"
  ManagedBy   = "terraform"
}

# Additional Tags (optional - merged with common_tags)
additional_tags = {
  # Department = "Engineering"
  # Purpose    = "Cost Optimization"
  # CreatedBy  = "Terraform"
}

# Alternative Scheduling Examples:
# cost_analysis_schedule = "rate(12 hours)"      # Run twice daily
# cost_analysis_schedule = "rate(1 hour)"        # Run hourly (for testing)
# cost_analysis_schedule = "cron(0 9 * * ? *)"   # Run daily at 9 AM UTC
# cost_analysis_schedule = "cron(0 0 ? * MON *)" # Run weekly on Mondays

# Production Configuration Example:
# project_name = "prod-lattice-analytics"
# environment  = "prod"
# cost_center  = "platform-engineering"
# owner        = "devops-team"
# enable_demo_vpc_lattice = false  # Disable demo resources in production
# lambda_memory_size = 1024        # Increase memory for production workloads

# Development Configuration Example:
# project_name = "dev-lattice-analytics"
# environment  = "dev"
# cost_analysis_schedule = "rate(1 hour)"  # More frequent testing
# lambda_timeout = 180                     # Shorter timeout for development
