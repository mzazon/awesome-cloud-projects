# AWS CDK Python Dependencies for VPC Lattice Cost Analytics Platform
# 
# This requirements file includes all necessary CDK libraries and Python packages
# for building a comprehensive service mesh cost analytics solution.

# Core AWS CDK v2 libraries
aws-cdk-lib==2.165.0
constructs>=10.0.0,<11.0.0

# AWS CDK construct libraries (included in aws-cdk-lib but listed for reference)
# aws-cdk.aws-lambda
# aws-cdk.aws-s3
# aws-cdk.aws-iam
# aws-cdk.aws-events
# aws-cdk.aws-events-targets
# aws-cdk.aws-cloudwatch
# aws-cdk.aws-logs
# aws-cdk.aws-vpclattice
# aws-cdk.aws-sns
# aws-cdk.aws-kms

# Python standard libraries used in Lambda function (built into runtime)
# json
# boto3
# datetime
# os
# logging

# Additional Python packages for enhanced functionality (optional)
# These would need to be included in a Lambda layer for production use
# aws-lambda-powertools[all]==2.28.0  # For enhanced observability
# pydantic==2.4.2                     # For data validation
# requests==2.31.0                    # For HTTP requests (if needed)

# Development and testing dependencies (optional)
# pytest==7.4.2
# boto3-stubs[essential]==1.29.7      # Type hints for boto3
# mypy==1.5.1                         # Static type checking
# black==23.7.0                       # Code formatting
# flake8==6.0.0                       # Linting

# CDK deployment dependencies
typing-extensions>=4.8.0

# Note: For production Lambda functions, consider using AWS Lambda Powertools
# and implementing proper logging, tracing, and metrics. These dependencies
# should be packaged in a Lambda layer rather than included directly.
