## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables
export AWS_REGION=$(aws configure get region)
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity \
    --query Account --output text)

# Generate unique identifiers for resources
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(aws secretsmanager get-random-password \
    --exclude-punctuation --exclude-uppercase \
    --password-length 6 --require-each-included-type \
    --output text --query RandomPassword)

# Set resource names
export TABLE_BUCKET_NAME="analytics-data-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export NAMESPACE_NAME="analytics_data"
export SAMPLE_TABLE_NAME="customer_events"

# Create Athena results bucket for query outputs
aws s3 mb s3://athena-results-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
    --region ${AWS_REGION}

aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
    --bucket athena-results-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
    --server-side-encryption-configuration \
    'Rules=[{ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault:{SSEAlgorithm:AES256}}]'

echo "✅ Environment configured with unique identifiers"
```

## Steps

1. **Create S3 Table Bucket for Analytics Storage**:

   S3 Tables provides a specialized bucket type designed specifically for Apache Iceberg tabular data storage. Unlike traditional S3 buckets that store unstructured objects, table buckets automatically optimize storage layout, manage metadata, and provide built-in table maintenance capabilities through automatic compaction and snapshot management. This creates the foundation for high-performance analytics workloads with automatic optimization and cost efficiency.

   ```bash
   # Create the table bucket
   aws s3tables create-table-bucket \
       --name ${TABLE_BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Store the table bucket ARN for future commands
   export TABLE_BUCKET_ARN=$(aws s3tables get-table-bucket \
       --name ${TABLE_BUCKET_NAME} \
       --query 'arn' --output text)
   
   echo "✅ Table bucket created: ${TABLE_BUCKET_ARN}"
   ```

   The table bucket is now ready to store Iceberg tables with automatic maintenance features enabled. This managed approach eliminates the operational overhead of manual table optimization while providing enterprise-grade durability (99.999999999% - 11 9's) and availability following AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.

2. **Create Namespace for Logical Data Organization**:

   Namespaces in S3 Tables provide logical grouping for related tables, similar to databases in traditional data warehouses. They enable better access control, organization, and management of table collections through AWS Lake Formation integration. Creating a well-structured namespace hierarchy supports data governance and simplifies permission management across analytics teams.

   ```bash
   # Create namespace for analytics data
   aws s3tables create-namespace \
       --table-bucket-arn ${TABLE_BUCKET_ARN} \
       --namespace ${NAMESPACE_NAME}
   
   # Verify namespace creation
   aws s3tables list-namespaces \
       --table-bucket-arn ${TABLE_BUCKET_ARN} \
       --query 'namespaces[].namespace' --output table
   
   echo "✅ Namespace '${NAMESPACE_NAME}' created successfully"
   ```

   The namespace provides a logical container for organizing related tables while supporting fine-grained access control through Lake Formation and resource management policies.

3. **Create Apache Iceberg Table with Optimized Schema**:

   Apache Iceberg tables in S3 Tables provide schema evolution, time travel capabilities, and automatic optimization features. The table creation establishes the structure for storing structured data with built-in performance optimizations including automatic file compaction, snapshot management, and garbage collection for continuous query performance optimization.

   ```bash
   # Create sample table for customer events
   aws s3tables create-table \
       --table-bucket-arn ${TABLE_BUCKET_ARN} \
       --namespace ${NAMESPACE_NAME} \
       --name ${SAMPLE_TABLE_NAME} \
       --format ICEBERG
   
   # Verify table creation
   aws s3tables get-table \
       --table-bucket-arn ${TABLE_BUCKET_ARN} \
       --namespace ${NAMESPACE_NAME} \
       --name ${SAMPLE_TABLE_NAME} \
       --query 'name' --output text
   
   echo "✅ Iceberg table '${SAMPLE_TABLE_NAME}' created"
   ```

   The Iceberg table now supports advanced analytics features including ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel queries while maintaining optimal query performance through automatic optimization and maintenance.

4. **Enable AWS Analytics Services Integration**:

   Integration with AWS analytics services connects S3 Tables with Amazon Athena, Redshift, EMR, and other query engines through AWS Glue Data Catalog and Lake Formation. This integration enables automatic table discovery and provides a unified interface for accessing table data across different analytics tools with proper security and governance controls.

   ```bash
   # Enable integration with AWS analytics services
   aws s3tables put-table-bucket-policy \
       --table-bucket-arn ${TABLE_BUCKET_ARN} \
       --resource-policy '{
           "Version": "2012-10-17",
           "Statement": [
               {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": {
                       "Service": [
                           "glue.amazonaws.com",
                           "lakeformation.amazonaws.com"
                       ]
                   },
                   "Action": [
                       "s3tables:GetTable",
                       "s3tables:GetTableMetadata"
                   ],
                   "Resource": "*"
               }
           ]
       }'
   
   # Wait for integration to propagate
   sleep 30
   
   echo "✅ Analytics services integration enabled"
   ```

   The integration now allows AWS analytics services to automatically discover and query tables through the unified data catalog interface with proper Lake Formation governance and security controls.

5. **Configure Athena Workgroup for Table Queries**:

   Amazon Athena provides serverless SQL query capabilities for S3 Tables with automatic scaling and pay-per-query pricing. Creating a dedicated workgroup establishes query execution settings, result location configuration, and cost controls for analytics workloads while enabling query result management and performance monitoring.

   ```bash
   # Create Athena workgroup for S3 Tables queries
   aws athena create-work-group \
       --name s3-tables-workgroup \
       --configuration 'ResultConfiguration={
           OutputLocation=s3://athena-results-'${RANDOM_SUFFIX}'/
       },EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration=true'
   
   # Set the workgroup as active
   aws athena update-work-group \
       --work-group s3-tables-workgroup \
       --state ENABLED
   
   echo "✅ Athena workgroup configured for S3 Tables"
   ```

   The Athena workgroup is now ready to execute SQL queries against S3 Tables with optimized performance and cost management features through dedicated resource allocation and query result management.

6. **Create Sample Data Definition Language (DDL) Schema**:

   Defining the table schema through DDL statements establishes the structure for storing analytics data with proper data types, partitioning, and optimization settings. This schema definition enables efficient data ingestion and query performance optimization through Apache Iceberg's advanced features including partition evolution and hidden partitioning.

   ```bash
   # Create DDL file for customer events table
   cat > customer_events_ddl.sql << 'EOF'
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS s3tablescatalog.analytics_data.customer_events (
       event_id STRING,
       customer_id STRING,
       event_type STRING,
       event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
       product_category STRING,
       amount DECIMAL(10,2),
       session_id STRING,
       user_agent STRING,
       event_date DATE
   )
   USING ICEBERG
   PARTITIONED BY (event_date)
   TBLPROPERTIES (
       'table_type'='ICEBERG',
       'format'='PARQUET',
       'write_compression'='SNAPPY'
   );
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ DDL schema definition created"
   ```

   The schema definition provides optimized storage configuration with date-based partitioning and SNAPPY compression settings for efficient analytics queries and cost-effective storage management.

7. **Insert Sample Analytics Data**:

   Loading sample data demonstrates the table's capabilities for storing structured analytics data while showcasing the automatic optimization features. The sample dataset represents common e-commerce analytics use cases with time-series data and categorical dimensions that demonstrate ACID transaction capabilities and query optimization.

   ```bash
   # Create sample data insertion script
   cat > insert_sample_data.sql << 'EOF'
   INSERT INTO s3tablescatalog.analytics_data.customer_events VALUES
   ('evt_001', 'cust_12345', 'page_view', 
    TIMESTAMP '2025-01-15 10:30:00', 'electronics', 0.00, 
    'sess_abc123', 'Mozilla/5.0', DATE '2025-01-15'),
   ('evt_002', 'cust_12345', 'add_to_cart', 
    TIMESTAMP '2025-01-15 10:35:00', 'electronics', 299.99, 
    'sess_abc123', 'Mozilla/5.0', DATE '2025-01-15'),
   ('evt_003', 'cust_67890', 'purchase', 
    TIMESTAMP '2025-01-15 11:00:00', 'clothing', 89.99, 
    'sess_def456', 'Chrome/100.0', DATE '2025-01-15'),
   ('evt_004', 'cust_54321', 'page_view', 
    TIMESTAMP '2025-01-15 11:15:00', 'books', 0.00, 
    'sess_ghi789', 'Safari/14.0', DATE '2025-01-15'),
   ('evt_005', 'cust_54321', 'purchase', 
    TIMESTAMP '2025-01-15 11:30:00', 'books', 24.99, 
    'sess_ghi789', 'Safari/14.0', DATE '2025-01-15');
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Sample data prepared for insertion"
   ```

   The sample data represents realistic analytics scenarios with customer events, timestamps, and business metrics ready for analysis with proper data type formatting and partition-aware organization.

8. **Execute Athena Queries on S3 Tables**:

   Running analytical queries demonstrates the performance benefits and capabilities of S3 Tables for business intelligence workloads. These queries showcase the automatic optimization features, ACID transaction support, and integration with AWS analytics services through the s3tablescatalog namespace.

   ```bash
   # Execute DDL query to create table structure
   QUERY_ID=$(aws athena start-query-execution \
       --query-string "$(cat customer_events_ddl.sql)" \
       --work-group s3-tables-workgroup \
       --query 'QueryExecutionId' --output text)
   
   # Wait for DDL query completion
   aws athena wait query-execution-complete \
       --query-execution-id ${QUERY_ID}
   
   echo "✅ DDL query completed successfully"
   
   # Execute data insertion query
   INSERT_QUERY_ID=$(aws athena start-query-execution \
       --query-string "$(cat insert_sample_data.sql)" \
       --work-group s3-tables-workgroup \
       --query 'QueryExecutionId' --output text)
   
   # Wait for insertion to complete
   aws athena wait query-execution-complete \
       --query-execution-id ${INSERT_QUERY_ID}
   
   echo "✅ Data insertion completed successfully"
   ```

   The queries demonstrate S3 Tables' ability to handle both DDL and DML operations with optimized performance, automatic maintenance, and ACID transaction guarantees for reliable analytics operations.
