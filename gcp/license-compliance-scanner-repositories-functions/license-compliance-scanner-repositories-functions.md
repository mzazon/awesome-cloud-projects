# License Compliance Scanner with Source Repositories and Functions

## Problem

Organizations struggle to track open source licenses across their codebases, creating legal and security risks. Manual license auditing is time-consuming and error-prone, often missing critical license conflicts or compliance violations. Development teams need automated scanning to identify license dependencies, detect incompatible license combinations, and generate compliance reports for legal teams before software releases.

## Solution

Create an automated license compliance system using Cloud Source Repositories for code storage, Cloud Functions for serverless scanning logic, Cloud Storage for report archiving, and Cloud Scheduler for periodic audits. This serverless approach provides cost-effective, scalable license scanning that integrates seamlessly with development workflows while maintaining comprehensive audit trails.

## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud project with billing enabled and required APIs access
2. gcloud CLI installed and configured (or Cloud Shell access)
3. Basic understanding of Git repositories and Python scripting
4. Email account configured for compliance notifications
5. Estimated cost: $5-15/month for small to medium repositories (Cloud Functions, Storage, Scheduler usage)

> **Note**: This recipe demonstrates core compliance scanning concepts. Production implementations should include additional security controls and integration with enterprise systems.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="license-scanner-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export BUCKET_NAME="license-reports-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export REPO_NAME="sample-app-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export FUNCTION_NAME="license-scanner-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable sourcerepo.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudscheduler.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ Bucket name: ${BUCKET_NAME}"
echo "✅ Repository name: ${REPO_NAME}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket for Compliance Reports**:

   Cloud Storage provides durable, cost-effective storage for compliance reports with built-in versioning and access controls. This bucket will store license scan results, historical compliance data, and audit trails required for legal and security reviews.

   ```bash
   # Create storage bucket with versioning enabled
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Enable versioning for audit trail compliance
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Set appropriate IAM policy for secure access
   gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:${PROJECT_ID}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com:objectAdmin gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Storage bucket created: gs://${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket now provides a secure, versioned repository for all compliance reports with appropriate access controls for legal team review.

2. **Create Cloud Source Repository with Sample Code**:

   Cloud Source Repositories provides fully managed Git hosting with integration to Google Cloud services. This repository will contain sample application code with various open source dependencies to demonstrate license scanning capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Source Repository
   gcloud source repos create ${REPO_NAME} \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Clone repository locally for sample code setup
   gcloud source repos clone ${REPO_NAME} \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Navigate to repository directory
   cd ${REPO_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Source repository created and cloned"
   ```

   The Git repository is now ready for code and dependency files that will be analyzed by the license compliance scanner.

3. **Add Sample Application with Dependencies**:

   Creating sample application files with common open source dependencies demonstrates real-world license scanning scenarios. These files include package managers' dependency declarations that contain license information.

   ```bash
   # Create sample Python application
   cat > app.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Sample application with open source dependencies."""

import requests
import flask
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

def main():
    print("License compliance scanner test application")
    print(f"Current time: {datetime.now()}")
    return "Application running successfully"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
   
   # Create requirements.txt with dependencies
   cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
Flask==3.0.3
requests==2.32.3
numpy==1.26.4
click==8.1.7
Jinja2==3.1.4
scancode-toolkit==32.4.0
license-expression==30.4.0
EOF
   
   # Create package.json for Node.js dependencies
   cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "sample-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.21.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21",
    "moment": "^2.30.1",
    "axios": "^1.7.9"
  }
}
EOF
   
   # Commit sample code to repository
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add sample application with dependencies"
   git push origin main
   
   echo "✅ Sample application code committed to repository"
   ```

   The repository now contains realistic dependency files that the license scanner will analyze to identify open source licenses and potential compliance issues.

4. **Create Enhanced License Scanner Cloud Function**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless execution for license scanning logic with automatic scaling and pay-per-invocation pricing. This enhanced function uses industry-standard tools like ScanCode Toolkit and SPDX license expressions for comprehensive analysis.

   ```bash
   # Create function directory and navigate
   mkdir -p ../license-scanner-function
   cd ../license-scanner-function
   
   # Create main function file with enhanced scanning capabilities
   cat > main.py << 'EOF'
import os

        license_data = analyze_dependencies()
        
        # Add compliance assessment
        compliance_result = assess_compliance(license_data)
        
        # Generate comprehensive report
        report = {

        # Upload report to Cloud Storage
        blob = bucket.blob(f"reports/{report_name}")
        blob.upload_from_string(
            json.dumps(report, indent=2),
            content_type='application/json'
        )
        
        logger.info(f"License scan completed successfully: {report_name}")
        
        return {
            "status": "success",

functions-framework==3.8.1
EOF
   
   echo "✅ Enhanced license scanner function code created"
   ```

   The Cloud Function now contains enhanced logic with industry-standard license analysis, SPDX compliance, and comprehensive risk assessment capabilities.

5. **Deploy License Scanner Function with Updated Runtime**:

   Deploying the Cloud Function with the latest Python runtime ensures optimal performance and security. The function automatically scales based on workload and integrates with other Google Cloud services.

   ```bash
   # Deploy Cloud Function with latest Python runtime and environment variables
   gcloud functions deploy ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --runtime python312 \
       --trigger-http \
       --allow-unauthenticated \
       --source . \
       --entry-point scan_licenses \
       --memory 512MB \
       --timeout 120s \
       --set-env-vars GCP_PROJECT=${PROJECT_ID},BUCKET_NAME=${BUCKET_NAME},REPO_NAME=${REPO_NAME}
   
   # Get function URL for testing
   FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud functions describe ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --format="value(httpsTrigger.url)")
   
   echo "✅ License scanner function deployed with Python 3.12 runtime"
   echo "Function URL: ${FUNCTION_URL}"
   ```

   The Cloud Function is now deployed with the latest Python 3.12 runtime and ready to process license scanning requests with enhanced memory and timeout settings.

6. **Create Automated Scanning Schedule**:

   Cloud Scheduler provides managed cron job functionality for triggering license scans at regular intervals. This automation ensures consistent compliance monitoring without manual intervention, supporting DevOps best practices.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Scheduler job for daily scans
   gcloud scheduler jobs create http license-scan-daily \
       --schedule="0 9 * * 1-5" \
       --uri=${FUNCTION_URL} \
       --http-method=POST \
       --time-zone="America/New_York" \
       --description="Daily license compliance scan"
   
   # Create additional job for weekly comprehensive scans
   gcloud scheduler jobs create http license-scan-weekly \
       --schedule="0 6 * * 1" \
       --uri=${FUNCTION_URL} \
       --http-method=POST \
       --time-zone="America/New_York" \
       --description="Weekly comprehensive license scan"
   
   echo "✅ Scheduled jobs created for automated scanning"
   echo "Daily scans: Weekdays at 9:00 AM EST"
   echo "Weekly scans: Mondays at 6:00 AM EST"
   ```

   The scheduler now automatically triggers license compliance scans according to business requirements, ensuring regular monitoring without manual oversight.

7. **Test Enhanced License Scanning Function**:

   Testing the deployed function validates the complete license scanning workflow from repository analysis through enhanced report generation. This verification ensures the system properly identifies dependencies and generates actionable compliance reports with SPDX compliance.

   ```bash
   # Trigger manual license scan for testing
   curl -X POST ${FUNCTION_URL} \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"test": true}'
   
   # Wait for processing to complete
   sleep 15
   
   # List generated reports in storage bucket
   gsutil ls gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/reports/
   
   echo "✅ Enhanced license scan test completed successfully"
   ```

   The function has now processed the repository contents and generated an enhanced compliance report with SPDX identifiers, risk assessment, and detailed recommendations stored in Cloud Storage.

## Validation & Testing

1. **Verify Cloud Function Deployment**:

   ```bash
   # Check function status and configuration
   gcloud functions describe ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --format="table(status,runtime,availableMemoryMb,timeout)"
   
   # Verify function logs for successful deployment
   gcloud functions logs read ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --limit=10
   ```

   Expected output: Function status should show "ACTIVE" with Python 3.12 runtime, 512MB memory, and 120s timeout.

2. **Test Repository Integration**:

   ```bash
   # Verify repository access and content
   gcloud source repos list --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Check repository contents
   cd ../${REPO_NAME}
   git log --oneline -n 5
   ```

   Expected output: Repository should list successfully with recent commits showing sample application files and enhanced dependencies.

3. **Validate Enhanced Report Generation**:

   ```bash
   # Download and review latest compliance report
   LATEST_REPORT=$(gsutil ls gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/reports/ | tail -1)
   gsutil cp ${LATEST_REPORT} ./latest-report.json
   
   # Display enhanced report contents
   cat latest-report.json | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

   Expected output: JSON report with enhanced dependency analysis, SPDX identifiers, risk assessment, and compliance recommendations.

4. **Test Scheduled Job Configuration**:

   ```bash
   # List scheduled jobs and their configuration
   gcloud scheduler jobs list \
       --format="table(name,schedule,state,timeZone)"
   
   # Test job execution manually
   gcloud scheduler jobs run license-scan-daily
   ```

   Expected output: Jobs should show "ENABLED" status with correct schedule configuration and successful manual execution.

## Cleanup

1. **Remove Cloud Scheduler Jobs**:

   ```bash
   # Delete scheduled scanning jobs
   gcloud scheduler jobs delete license-scan-daily --quiet
   gcloud scheduler jobs delete license-scan-weekly --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Scheduler jobs removed"
   ```

2. **Delete Cloud Function**:

   ```bash
   # Remove license scanning function
   gcloud functions delete ${FUNCTION_NAME} --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Function deleted"
   ```

3. **Remove Cloud Storage Bucket**:

   ```bash
   # Delete all objects and bucket
   gsutil -m rm -r gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Storage bucket and reports deleted"
   ```

4. **Delete Source Repository**:

   ```bash
   # Remove Cloud Source Repository
   gcloud source repos delete ${REPO_NAME} --quiet
   
   # Clean up local repository files
   cd ..
   rm -rf ${REPO_NAME} license-scanner-function
   
   echo "✅ Source repository and local files removed"
   ```

5. **Clean Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   # Remove environment variables
   unset PROJECT_ID REGION ZONE BUCKET_NAME REPO_NAME FUNCTION_NAME RANDOM_SUFFIX
   
   echo "✅ Environment variables cleared"
   echo "Note: Project deletion recommended if created specifically for this recipe"
   ```

## Discussion

License compliance scanning addresses critical business needs in modern software development where open source dependencies comprise 70-90% of typical applications. This automated approach eliminates manual audit overhead while providing consistent, repeatable compliance validation throughout the development lifecycle. The enhanced implementation uses industry-standard tools like [ScanCode Toolkit](https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/) and [SPDX license expressions](https://spdx.dev/) for comprehensive analysis.

The serverless architecture using Cloud Functions provides cost-effective scaling that adapts to repository size and scanning frequency. Unlike traditional license scanning tools that require dedicated infrastructure, this solution operates on a pay-per-scan model that reduces operational costs while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability. The integration with Cloud Source Repositories enables real-time scanning as code changes, supporting shift-left security practices. The upgraded Python 3.12 runtime ensures optimal performance and access to the latest language features.

Cloud Storage provides long-term retention of compliance reports required for legal audits and regulatory compliance. The versioning capability maintains historical compliance data, enabling trend analysis and demonstrating due diligence during software audits. This approach supports enterprise governance requirements while integrating seamlessly with existing DevOps workflows. Enhanced reports now include SPDX compliance identifiers, detailed risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for legal teams.

The scheduling automation ensures consistent compliance monitoring without requiring dedicated security team resources. This proactive approach identifies license conflicts before software releases, reducing legal risk and enabling faster remediation. Organizations can customize scanning frequency based on development velocity and compliance requirements while maintaining comprehensive audit trails for regulatory reporting.

> **Tip**: For production deployments, consider integrating with [FOSSA](https://fossa.com/) or [WhiteSource](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/) for enterprise-grade license management, and implement additional security controls such as Cloud KMS for report encryption and Cloud IAM for granular access management.

## Challenge

Extend this solution by implementing these enhancements:

1. **Advanced License Analysis**: Integrate with the complete ScanCode Toolkit API to perform deep dependency tree analysis, detect transitive dependencies, and implement conflict detection algorithms using the license-expression library for complex SPDX license expressions.

2. **Multi-Repository Scanning**: Extend the function to scan multiple repositories using Cloud Build triggers, implement parallel processing for large codebases with dependency caching, and add support for monorepo architectures with selective scanning.

3. **Policy Enforcement**: Create automated policy checks using the [REUSE tool](https://reuse.software/) that block deployments with high-risk licenses and integrate with CI/CD pipelines using Cloud Build and Binary Authorization for compliance gates.

4. **Real-time Notifications**: Implement Pub/Sub messaging and Cloud Functions to send immediate alerts for critical license violations, with integration to Slack or email using SendGrid for rapid response and escalation workflows.

5. **Enterprise Integration**: Add SAML/OIDC authentication, role-based access controls, and integration with enterprise compliance platforms like [FOSSology](https://www.fossology.org/) using Cloud IAM and third-party APIs for comprehensive governance workflows.
