# Educational Content Generation with Gemini and Text-to-Speech

## Problem

Educational institutions and e-learning platforms struggle to create comprehensive, accessible content at scale from curriculum outlines. Manual content creation is time-consuming, expensive, and often lacks consistency in quality and audio accessibility features. Traditional approaches fail to provide both engaging text materials and natural-sounding audio lessons that accommodate different learning styles and accessibility needs.

## Solution

Leverage Vertex AI's Gemini 2.5 Flash model to automatically generate detailed educational content from curriculum outlines, convert the generated text to natural-sounding audio using Google's Text-to-Speech API with high-quality voices, and orchestrate the entire workflow using Cloud Functions with Firestore for content lifecycle management. This serverless architecture scales automatically while maintaining cost efficiency.

export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export FUNCTION_NAME="content-generator-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BUCKET_NAME="edu-audio-content-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export FIRESTORE_COLLECTION="educational_content"

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set functions/region ${REGION}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable texttospeech.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable firestore.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage-api.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ APIs enabled for content generation pipeline"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Firestore Database for Content Management**:

   Firestore provides a serverless, NoSQL document database that automatically scales with real-time synchronization capabilities. Setting up Firestore in Native mode enables advanced querying features and seamless integration with Cloud Functions for event-driven content processing workflows.

   ```bash
   # Create Firestore database in Native mode
   gcloud firestore databases create \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --type=firestore-native
   
   echo "✅ Firestore database created successfully"
   ```

   The Firestore database is now ready to store curriculum outlines, generated content, and processing metadata with automatic scaling and real-time synchronization across all connected services.

2. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket for Audio Files**:

   Cloud Storage provides unified object storage with global edge caching for audio file distribution. Configuring the bucket with appropriate location and access controls ensures optimal performance for serving educational audio content worldwide.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Storage bucket for audio files
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Configure bucket for public read access (for educational content distribution)
   gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Storage bucket created: ${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket now provides scalable, cost-effective storage for generated audio files with global distribution capabilities through Google's edge network.

3. **Create Python Function for Content Generation**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless compute that automatically scales based on request volume. Creating the function code that integrates Vertex AI Gemini for content generation and Text-to-Speech for audio synthesis enables automated processing without infrastructure management.

   ```bash
   # Create function directory and main Python file
   mkdir -p ${FUNCTION_NAME}
   cd ${FUNCTION_NAME}
   
   cat > main.py << 'EOF'
import functions_framework
import json
import os
from google.cloud import aiplatform
from google.cloud import texttospeech
from google.cloud import firestore
from google.cloud import storage
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel

# Initialize clients
db = firestore.Client()
tts_client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()
storage_client = storage.Client()

@functions_framework.http
def generate_content(request):
    """Generate educational content from curriculum outline."""
    
    # Parse request
    request_json = request.get_json()
    outline = request_json.get('outline', '')
    topic = request_json.get('topic', 'Educational Content')
    voice_name = request_json.get('voice_name', 'en-US-Studio-M')
    
    if not outline:
        return {'error': 'Curriculum outline is required'}, 400
    
    try:
        # Initialize Vertex AI
        vertexai.init(project=os.environ.get('GCP_PROJECT'))
        model = GenerativeModel('gemini-2.5-flash')
        
        # Generate educational content using Gemini
        prompt = f"""
        Create comprehensive educational content based on this curriculum outline:
        
        {outline}
        
        Generate:
        1. A detailed lesson plan (200-300 words)
        2. Key learning objectives (3-5 bullet points)
        3. Explanatory content suitable for audio narration (400-500 words)
        4. Practice questions (3-5 questions)
        
        Format the response as structured, educational content that flows naturally when read aloud.
        Focus on clarity, engagement, and pedagogical best practices.
        """
        
        response = model.generate_content(prompt)
        generated_content = response.text
        
        # Store content in Firestore
        doc_ref = db.collection('educational_content').add({
            'topic': topic,
            'outline': outline,
            'generated_content': generated_content,
            'timestamp': firestore.SERVER_TIMESTAMP,
            'status': 'content_generated'
        })[1]
        
        # Generate audio using Text-to-Speech
        synthesis_input = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text=generated_content)
        voice = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(
            language_code='en-US',
            name=voice_name
        )
        audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(
            audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3,
            speaking_rate=0.9,
            pitch=0.0
        )
        
        tts_response = tts_client.synthesize_speech(
            input=synthesis_input,
            voice=voice,
            audio_config=audio_config
        )
        
        # Upload audio to Cloud Storage
        bucket_name = os.environ.get('BUCKET_NAME')
        bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
        audio_filename = f"lessons/{doc_ref.id}.mp3"
        blob = bucket.blob(audio_filename)
        blob.upload_from_string(tts_response.audio_content, content_type='audio/mpeg')
        
        # Update Firestore with audio URL
        doc_ref.update({
            'audio_url': f"gs://{bucket_name}/{audio_filename}",
            'status': 'completed'
        })
        
        return {
            'status': 'success',
            'document_id': doc_ref.id,
            'content_preview': generated_content[:200] + '...',
            'audio_url': f"gs://{bucket_name}/{audio_filename}"
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        return {'error': str(e)}, 500
EOF
   
   echo "✅ Function code created successfully"
   ```

   The function integrates multiple Google Cloud AI services to create a complete content generation pipeline with automatic error handling and status tracking.

4. **Create Requirements File for Dependencies**:

   Python dependencies define the required libraries for AI model interaction, cloud service integration, and serverless function execution. Managing dependencies properly ensures consistent behavior and optimal cold start performance.

   ```bash
   cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
functions-framework==3.9.1
google-cloud-aiplatform==1.105.0
google-cloud-texttospeech==2.27.0
google-cloud-firestore==2.18.0
google-cloud-storage==2.18.2
EOF
   
   echo "✅ Requirements file created"
   ```

   The dependencies are optimized for serverless execution with the latest stable versions of Google Cloud client libraries.

5. **Deploy Cloud Function with Environment Variables**:

   Deploying the Cloud Function with proper environment variables and resource allocation ensures optimal performance for AI workloads. The function automatically scales based on request volume while maintaining cost efficiency through pay-per-invocation pricing.

   ```bash
   # Deploy Cloud Function with required environment variables
   gcloud functions deploy ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --runtime python311 \
       --trigger-http \
       --source . \
       --entry-point generate_content \
       --memory 1024MB \
       --timeout 540s \
       --set-env-vars GCP_PROJECT=${PROJECT_ID},BUCKET_NAME=${BUCKET_NAME} \
       --allow-unauthenticated
   
   # Get function URL
   FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud functions describe ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --format="value(httpsTrigger.url)")
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Function deployed successfully"
   echo "Function URL: ${FUNCTION_URL}"
   ```

   The Cloud Function is now deployed with sufficient memory and timeout for AI model inference and audio synthesis, enabling automated content generation at scale.

6. **Create Sample Educational Content Request**:

   Testing the content generation pipeline with realistic curriculum data validates the integration between Gemini AI, Text-to-Speech, and Firestore. This demonstrates the complete workflow from curriculum outline to generated audio lessons.
