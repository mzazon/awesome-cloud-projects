## Steps

1. **Create BigQuery Dataset and Sample Data**:

   BigQuery serves as the foundation for our data storytelling pipeline, providing serverless data warehousing capabilities that scale automatically based on query complexity. We'll create a dataset with sample retail data that represents common business scenarios, enabling us to demonstrate meaningful analytics patterns and storytelling opportunities.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset for analytics
   bq mk --dataset \
       --description="Dataset for interactive data storytelling" \
       --location=${REGION} \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   # Create sample retail sales table with comprehensive business data
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.sales_data \
       product_id:STRING,product_name:STRING,category:STRING,sales_date:DATE,quantity:INTEGER,unit_price:FLOAT,customer_segment:STRING,region:STRING,revenue:FLOAT
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery dataset and table created successfully"
   ```

   The dataset structure is now established with a comprehensive sales schema that captures key business dimensions including products, customers, geography, and time. This foundation enables sophisticated analytical queries and supports various storytelling scenarios from revenue trends to customer segmentation insights.

2. **Load Sample Data for Analytics**:

   Realistic sample data is essential for demonstrating effective data storytelling capabilities. We'll populate our dataset with synthetic retail data that reflects common business patterns, seasonal trends, and customer behaviors that analytics teams typically encounter in real-world scenarios.

   ```bash
   # Create temporary file with sample retail data
   cat > /tmp/sample_sales_data.csv << 'EOF'

   EOF
   
   # Load data into BigQuery table
   bq load \
       --source_format=CSV \
       --skip_leading_rows=1 \
       --autodetect \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.sales_data \
       /tmp/sample_sales_data.csv
   
   # Verify data loading with sample query
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
       "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records, 
               SUM(revenue) as total_revenue,
               COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) as unique_products
        FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.sales_data\`"
   
   echo "✅ Sample data loaded and verified"
   ```

   Our dataset now contains diverse retail transactions spanning multiple product categories, customer segments, and geographic regions. This data variety provides rich material for AI-powered insights and enables the creation of compelling data stories that demonstrate business trends and opportunities.

3. **Set Up Vertex AI Gemini Integration**:

   Vertex AI Gemini provides advanced natural language processing capabilities that can analyze data patterns and generate human-readable insights.

4. **Create Data Analysis Queries with AI Insights**:

   Sophisticated analytical queries combined with AI-generated insights form the core of effective data storytelling. We'll create parameterized queries that analyze key business metrics and leverage Gemini to generate contextual explanations that transform data points into actionable business intelligence.

   ```bash
   # Create comprehensive analytics query for insights generation
   cat > /tmp/analytics_query.sql << 'EOF'
   WITH revenue_trends AS (
     SELECT 
       category,
       customer_segment,
       region,
       SUM(revenue) as total_revenue,
       COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) as product_count,
       AVG(unit_price) as avg_price,
       SUM(quantity) as total_quantity
     FROM `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_NAME.sales_data`
     GROUP BY category, customer_segment, region
   ),
   performance_metrics AS (
     SELECT 
       category,
       SUM(total_revenue) as category_revenue,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(total_revenue) DESC) as revenue_rank
     FROM revenue_trends
     GROUP BY category
   )
   SELECT 
     rt.*,
     pm.revenue_rank,
     ROUND(rt.total_revenue / pm.category_revenue * 100, 2) as segment_contribution_pct
   FROM revenue_trends rt
   JOIN performance_metrics pm ON rt.category = pm.category
   ORDER BY rt.total_revenue DESC;
   EOF
   
   # Execute analytics query with current project and dataset
   sed "s/PROJECT_ID/${PROJECT_ID}/g; s/DATASET_NAME/${DATASET_NAME}/g" /tmp/analytics_query.sql > /tmp/final_query.sql
   
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < /tmp/final_query.sql
   
   echo "✅ Analytics queries created and tested"
   ```

   The analytical foundation is now established with sophisticated queries that reveal business insights across multiple dimensions.

        """
        
        query_job = bq_client.query(query)
        results = query_job.result()
        
        # Convert to DataFrame for analysis
        df = results.to_dataframe()
        
        # Generate insights summary
        total_revenue = df['total_revenue'].sum()
        top_category = df.iloc[0]['category']
        top_segment = df.iloc[0]['customer_segment']
        
        # Create story narrative
        story = {
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
            'key_insights': {
                'total_revenue': float(total_revenue),
                'top_performing_category': top_category,
                'leading_customer_segment': top_segment,
