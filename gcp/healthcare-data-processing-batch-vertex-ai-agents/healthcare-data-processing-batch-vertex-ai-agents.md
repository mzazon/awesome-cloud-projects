```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket for Healthcare Data**:

   Google Cloud Storage provides enterprise-grade security and HIPAA compliance capabilities essential for healthcare data. The bucket will serve as the secure entry point for medical records, with versioning and audit logging enabled to maintain data integrity and compliance tracking throughout the processing pipeline.

   ```bash
   # Create HIPAA-compliant storage bucket
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Enable versioning for data protection
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Enable uniform bucket-level access for security
   gsutil uniformbucketlevelaccess set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ HIPAA-compliant storage bucket created: ${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket is now configured with versioning and proper security controls, providing a secure foundation for healthcare data ingestion. This setup ensures data lineage tracking and supports regulatory audit requirements while enabling scalable access for downstream processing services.

2. **Set Up Cloud Healthcare API Dataset and FHIR Store**:

   The Cloud Healthcare API provides FHIR-compliant data storage and processing capabilities specifically designed for healthcare applications. Creating a dedicated dataset and FHIR store establishes the structured data layer that enables interoperability with existing healthcare systems while maintaining compliance with healthcare data standards.

   ```bash
   # Create healthcare dataset
   gcloud healthcare datasets create ${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --description="Healthcare AI processing dataset"
   
   # Create FHIR store for patient records
   gcloud healthcare fhir-stores create ${FHIR_STORE_ID} \
       --dataset=${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --version=R4 \
       --enable-update-create
   
   # Create IAM policy for healthcare service account
   cat > fhir-policy.json << EOF
   {
     "bindings": [
       {
         "role": "roles/healthcare.fhirResourceEditor",
         "members": [
           "serviceAccount:${PROJECT_ID}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF
   
   # Apply IAM policy to FHIR store
   gcloud healthcare fhir-stores set-iam-policy ${FHIR_STORE_ID} \
       --dataset=${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       fhir-policy.json
   
   echo "✅ Healthcare API dataset and FHIR store created"
   ```

   The FHIR store now provides a standards-compliant repository for processed healthcare data. This infrastructure enables seamless integration with electronic health record systems and supports advanced querying capabilities for clinical decision support and population health analytics.

3. **Create Vertex AI Agent for Healthcare Analysis**:

   Vertex AI Agent Builder enables the creation of specialized AI agents trained on healthcare-specific models and compliance requirements. The agent will analyze medical records, extract clinical insights, identify compliance issues, and route critical findings to appropriate stakeholders while maintaining context awareness of medical terminology and protocols.

   ```bash
   # Create service account for Vertex AI agent
   gcloud iam service-accounts create healthcare-ai-agent \
       --display-name="Healthcare AI Analysis Agent" \
       --description="Service account for AI-powered healthcare data analysis"
   
   # Grant necessary permissions to the agent
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:healthcare-ai-agent@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:healthcare-ai-agent@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/healthcare.fhirResourceEditor"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:healthcare-ai-agent@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/storage.objectViewer"
   
   # Note: Vertex AI Agent Builder configuration is primarily done through the console
   # The following demonstrates the conceptual agent setup
   cat > agent-config.yaml << EOF
   displayName: "Healthcare Records Analyzer"
   description: "AI agent for intelligent healthcare data processing and compliance monitoring"
   tools:
     - healthcare_nlp_tool
     - compliance_checker_tool
     - clinical_insights_extractor
   instructions: |
     You are a healthcare AI agent specialized in medical record analysis.
     Process medical documents while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
     Extract clinical insights, identify critical findings, and ensure data accuracy.
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Vertex AI healthcare agent service account configured"
   echo "Note: Complete agent setup in Vertex AI Agent Builder console"
   ```

   The Vertex AI agent service account is now equipped with appropriate permissions to process medical data securely. This service account will be used by the processing pipeline to access AI capabilities while maintaining proper security boundaries for healthcare data.

4. **Configure Cloud Batch Job Template**:

   Cloud Batch orchestrates scalable compute workloads with automatic resource provisioning and job scheduling. Creating a template for healthcare data processing ensures consistent execution environments while enabling cost-effective scaling based on data volume and processing complexity.

   ```bash
   # Create batch job template for healthcare processing
   cat > healthcare-batch-job.json << EOF
   {
     "allocationPolicy": {
       "instances": [
         {
           "policy": {
             "machineType": "e2-standard-2",
             "provisioningModel": "STANDARD"
           }
         }
       ]
     },
     "taskGroups": [
       {
         "taskSpec": {
           "runnables": [
             {
               "script": {
                 "text": "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Starting healthcare data processing...'\npython3 /healthcare_processor.py --input-bucket=\${BUCKET_NAME} --fhir-store=\${FHIR_STORE_ID} --project=\${PROJECT_ID} --region=\${REGION}\necho 'Healthcare processing completed'"
               }
             }
           ],
           "computeResource": {
             "cpuMilli": 2000,
             "memoryMib": 4096
           },
           "maxRetryCount": 3,
           "maxRunDuration": "3600s"
         },
         "taskCount": 1,
         "parallelism": 1
       }
     ],
     "logsPolicy": {
       "destination": "CLOUD_LOGGING"
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Batch job template created for healthcare processing"
   ```

   The batch job template establishes a robust execution framework for healthcare data processing with appropriate resource allocation and retry policies. This configuration ensures reliable processing of medical records while maintaining cost efficiency through automatic resource management and failure recovery.

5. **Deploy Cloud Function for Automated Job Triggering**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless compute that automatically triggers batch processing when new healthcare data arrives. This event-driven architecture ensures immediate processing of urgent medical records while maintaining scalability and cost efficiency through pay-per-use pricing.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Function for job triggering
   mkdir healthcare-function
   cd healthcare-function
   
   # Create function source code
   cat > main.py << EOF
   import functions_framework

                           "provisioning_model": "STANDARD"
                       }
                   }
               ]
           },
           "task_groups": [
               {
                   "task_spec": {
                       "runnables": [

                       }
                   },
                   "task_count": 1
               }
           ]
       }
       
       # Submit the batch job
       parent = f"projects/{os.environ['PROJECT_ID']}/locations/{os.environ['REGION']}"
       job_id = f"healthcare-processing-{file_name.replace('/', '-').replace('.', '-')}"
       
       response = batch_client.create_job(
           parent=parent,
           job_id=job_id,
           job=job
       )
       
       print(f"Healthcare processing job created: {response.name}")

   cd ..
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Function deployed for automated healthcare processing"
   ```

   The Cloud Function now provides automated triggering of healthcare data processing jobs whenever new medical records are uploaded. This serverless orchestration ensures immediate response to new data while maintaining cost efficiency and scalability for varying data volumes and processing requirements.

6. **Configure Healthcare Data Processing Pipeline**:

   The processing pipeline integrates Vertex AI agents with Cloud Batch to analyze medical records, extract clinical insights, and ensure compliance. This comprehensive workflow processes various healthcare data formats while maintaining FHIR compliance and generating actionable intelligence for clinical decision support.

   ```bash
   # Create healthcare data processor script
