# Multi-Cloud Cost Optimization with Cloud Billing API and Cloud Recommender

## Problem

Organizations operating across multiple Google Cloud projects face significant challenges in managing and optimizing their cloud spending. Manual cost analysis across dozens of projects is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in missed optimization opportunities. Finance teams struggle to identify cost anomalies in real-time, while engineering teams lack actionable insights to optimize resource usage. Without automated cost optimization, organizations often overspend by 20-30% due to idle resources, oversized instances, and suboptimal committed use discount strategies.

## Solution

Build an intelligent cost optimization system that automatically analyzes billing data across multiple projects using the Cloud Billing API and Cloud Recommender. The system continuously monitors spending patterns, generates actionable recommendations, and triggers automated responses through Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub. This comprehensive solution provides real-time cost insights, proactive optimization recommendations, and automated remediation workflows to achieve significant cost savings while maintaining operational excellence.

## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud organization with multiple projects and billing accounts
2. Cloud SDK installed and configured (gcloud CLI)
3. Billing Account Administrator or Editor role for cost management
4. Project Editor role for deploying Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub
5. BigQuery Admin role for data analysis and reporting
6. Estimated cost: $50-100/month for moderate usage across 10-20 projects

> **Note**: This recipe requires active billing accounts with historical data for meaningful cost analysis and recommendations.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="cost-optimization-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"
export BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID=$(gcloud billing accounts list \
    --format="value(name)" --limit=1)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export DATASET_NAME="cost_optimization_${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BUCKET_NAME="cost-optimization-${PROJECT_ID}-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export TOPIC_NAME="cost-optimization-topic-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create new project for cost optimization system
gcloud projects create ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --name="Cost Optimization System"

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Link billing account to project
gcloud billing projects link ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --billing-account=${BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com \
    cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
    pubsub.googleapis.com \
    bigquery.googleapis.com \
    storage.googleapis.com \
    recommender.googleapis.com \
    cloudscheduler.googleapis.com \
    monitoring.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ Billing account linked: ${BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create BigQuery Dataset for Cost Analytics**:

   BigQuery provides a serverless data warehouse perfectly suited for analyzing large volumes of billing data across multiple projects. Creating a dedicated dataset establishes the foundation for cost trend analysis, anomaly detection, and optimization reporting. This centralized data repository enables complex queries across billing periods and projects while maintaining high performance for real-time analytics.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset for cost optimization
   bq mk --dataset \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --description="Cost optimization analytics dataset" \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   # Create cost analysis table with optimized schema
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.cost_analysis \
       project_id:STRING,billing_account_id:STRING,service:STRING,cost:FLOAT,currency:STRING,usage_date:DATE,optimization_potential:FLOAT,created_timestamp:TIMESTAMP
   
   # Create recommendations table with comprehensive tracking
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.recommendations \
       project_id:STRING,recommender_type:STRING,recommendation_id:STRING,description:STRING,potential_savings:FLOAT,priority:STRING,created_date:TIMESTAMP,status:STRING
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery dataset and tables created successfully"
   ```

   The BigQuery dataset now provides scalable storage for cost data with optimized schema design for analytical queries. This foundation supports both historical trend analysis and real-time cost monitoring across your entire Google Cloud organization.

2. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket for Reports and Data**:

   Cloud Storage provides durable, globally accessible storage for cost reports, recommendation exports, and intermediate data processing. The bucket serves as a staging area for data pipelines and a repository for generated cost optimization reports that can be accessed by various stakeholders across the organization.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Storage bucket for cost optimization data
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Enable versioning for data protection
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Create folder structure for organized data storage
   echo "" | gsutil cp - gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/reports/.gitkeep
   echo "" | gsutil cp - gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/recommendations/.gitkeep
   echo "" | gsutil cp - gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/exports/.gitkeep
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Storage bucket created: gs://${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket is now configured with versioning enabled and organized folder structure, providing reliable data storage and easy access to cost optimization artifacts for team collaboration and reporting workflows.

3. **Create Pub/Sub Topics for Event-Driven Processing**:

   Cloud Pub/Sub enables asynchronous, event-driven architecture for cost optimization workflows. The messaging system decouples cost analysis from recommendation generation and automated responses, ensuring scalable and reliable processing of cost events across multiple projects and billing accounts.

   ```bash
   # Create main topic for cost optimization events
   gcloud pubsub topics create ${TOPIC_NAME}
   
   # Create additional topics for specific workflows
   gcloud pubsub topics create cost-analysis-results
   gcloud pubsub topics create recommendations-generated
   gcloud pubsub topics create optimization-alerts
   
   # Create subscriptions for Cloud Functions
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create cost-analysis-sub \
       --topic=${TOPIC_NAME}
   
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create recommendations-sub \
       --topic=recommendations-generated
   
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create alerts-sub \
       --topic=optimization-alerts
   
   echo "✅ Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions created"
   ```

   The messaging infrastructure now supports event-driven cost optimization with dedicated channels for different workflow stages, enabling parallel processing and fault-tolerant message delivery across the entire system.

4. **Deploy Cost Analysis Cloud Function**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless execution for cost analysis logic, automatically scaling based on billing events and API calls. The cost analysis function retrieves billing data, calculates optimization metrics, and identifies cost anomalies across multiple projects with built-in retry logic and error handling.

   ```bash
   # Create source directory for cost analysis function
   mkdir -p cost-analysis-function
   cd cost-analysis-function
   
   # Create main function file
   cat > main.py << 'EOF'
import json
import logging
from google.cloud import billing_v1
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import os

def analyze_costs(event, context):
    """Analyze costs across projects and detect anomalies"""
    
    # Initialize clients
    billing_client = billing_v1.CloudBillingClient()
    bq_client = bigquery.Client()
    publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
    
    # Configuration
    dataset_id = os.environ.get('DATASET_NAME')
    project_id = os.environ.get('PROJECT_ID')
    topic_name = f"projects/{project_id}/topics/recommendations-generated"
    
    try:
        # Get billing accounts
        billing_accounts = billing_client.list_billing_accounts()
        
        for account in billing_accounts:
            account_id = account.name.split('/')[-1]
            
            # Get projects linked to billing account
            projects = billing_client.list_project_billing_info(
                name=account.name
            )
            
            for project in projects:
                if project.billing_enabled:
                    project_id_clean = project.project_id
                    
                    # Analyze project costs (simplified example - would use actual Billing Export data)
                    cost_data = {
                        'project_id': project_id_clean,
                        'billing_account_id': account_id,
                        'service': 'compute',
                        'cost': 150.00,  # In production, this would come from actual billing data
                        'currency': 'USD',
                        'usage_date': datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
                        'optimization_potential': 30.00,
                        'created_timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
                    }
                    
                    # Insert into BigQuery
                    table_id = f"{project_id}.{dataset_id}.cost_analysis"
                    table = bq_client.get_table(table_id)
                    
                    rows_to_insert = [cost_data]
                    errors = bq_client.insert_rows_json(table, rows_to_insert)
                    
                    if not errors:
                        logging.info(f"Cost data inserted for project: {project_id_clean}")
                        
                        # Publish to recommendations topic
                        message_data = json.dumps({
                            'project_id': project_id_clean,
                            'cost_data': cost_data,
                            'trigger': 'cost_analysis'
                        })
                        
                        publisher.publish(topic_name, message_data.encode('utf-8'))
                    else:
                        logging.error(f"BigQuery insert errors: {errors}")
        
        return {"status": "success", "message": "Cost analysis completed"}
        
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Cost analysis failed: {str(e)}")
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}
EOF
   
   # Create requirements file with updated versions
   cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
google-cloud-billing==1.13.3
google-cloud-bigquery==3.25.0
google-cloud-pubsub==2.23.0

   # Deploy the function with Python 3.12 runtime
   gcloud functions deploy analyze-costs \
       --runtime python312 \
       --trigger-topic ${TOPIC_NAME} \
       --source . \
       --entry-point analyze_costs \
       --memory 256MB \
       --timeout 300s \
       --set-env-vars "DATASET_NAME=${DATASET_NAME},PROJECT_ID=${PROJECT_ID}"
   
   cd ..
   echo "✅ Cost analysis function deployed successfully"
   ```

   The cost analysis function now automatically processes billing events, performs multi-project cost analysis, and stores results in BigQuery while triggering downstream recommendation workflows through Pub/Sub messaging. The function uses the latest Python 3.12 runtime for improved performance and security.

5. **Deploy Recommendation Engine Function**:

   The recommendation engine leverages Google Cloud Recommender to generate actionable cost optimization suggestions. Cloud Recommender analyzes resource usage patterns, identifies optimization opportunities, and provides specific recommendations for rightsizing, committed use discounts, and idle resource cleanup with quantified savings potential.

   ```bash
   # Create source directory for recommendation engine
   mkdir -p recommendation-engine
   cd recommendation-engine
   
   # Create main function file
   cat > main.py << 'EOF'
import json
import logging
from google.cloud import recommender_v1
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.cloud import storage
from datetime import datetime
import os

def generate_recommendations(event, context):
    """Generate cost optimization recommendations"""
    
    # Initialize clients
    recommender_client = recommender_v1.RecommenderClient()
    bq_client = bigquery.Client()
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    
    # Configuration
    dataset_id = os.environ.get('DATASET_NAME')
    project_id = os.environ.get('PROJECT_ID')
    bucket_name = os.environ.get('BUCKET_NAME')
    
    try:
        # Parse incoming message
        message_data = json.loads(event['data'].decode('utf-8'))
        target_project = message_data.get('project_id')
        
        # Define multiple recommender types for comprehensive analysis
        recommender_types = [
            'google.compute.instance.MachineTypeRecommender',
            'google.compute.disk.IdleResourceRecommender',
            'google.cloudsql.instance.OutOfDiskRecommender'
        ]
        
        all_recommendations = []
        
        for recommender_type in recommender_types:
            try:
                # Get cost recommendations for the project
                parent = f"projects/{target_project}/locations/global/recommenders/{recommender_type}"
                
                recommendations = recommender_client.list_recommendations(
                    parent=parent
                )
                
                for recommendation in recommendations:
                    # Extract recommendation details with improved error handling
                    potential_savings = 0.0
                    if (recommendation.primary_impact and 
                        recommendation.primary_impact.cost_projection and 
                        recommendation.primary_impact.cost_projection.cost and
                        recommendation.primary_impact.cost_projection.cost.units):
                        potential_savings = float(recommendation.primary_impact.cost_projection.cost.units)

                        'created_date': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                        'status': 'ACTIVE'
                    }
                    
                    all_recommendations.append(rec_data)

            except Exception as e:
                logging.warning(f"No recommendations available for {recommender_type} in project {target_project}: {str(e)}")
                continue
        
        # Generate summary report
        total_savings = sum(r['potential_savings'] for r in all_recommendations)
        report_content = {
            'project_id': target_project,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            'total_recommendations': len(all_recommendations),
            'total_potential_savings': total_savings,
            'recommendations': all_recommendations
        }
        
        # Save report to Cloud Storage
        bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
        blob_name = f"recommendations/{target_project}_recommendations_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.json"
        blob = bucket.blob(blob_name)

   echo "✅ Recommendation engine function deployed successfully"
   ```

   The recommendation engine now automatically generates actionable cost optimization suggestions using Google Cloud Recommender, analyzes multiple recommender types for comprehensive coverage, and creates detailed reports in Cloud Storage for stakeholder review and implementation tracking.

6. **Create Optimization Automation Function**:

   Automation functions enable proactive cost optimization by automatically implementing low-risk recommendations and alerting on high-value opportunities. This serverless approach ensures continuous optimization without manual intervention while maintaining safety controls and audit trails for all automated actions.

   ```bash
   # Create source directory for optimization automation
   mkdir -p optimization-automation
   cd optimization-automation
   
   # Create main function file
   cat > main.py << 'EOF'
import json
import logging
from google.cloud import monitoring_v3
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
from google.cloud import bigquery
from datetime import datetime
import os
import requests

def optimize_resources(event, context):
    """Automate resource optimization based on recommendations"""
    
    # Initialize clients
    monitoring_client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
    publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
    bq_client = bigquery.Client()
    
    # Configuration
    project_id = os.environ.get('PROJECT_ID')
    webhook_url = os.environ.get('SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL', '')
    
    try:
        # Parse incoming message
        message_data = json.loads(event['data'].decode('utf-8'))
        
        # Check for high-value optimization opportunities
        potential_savings = message_data.get('potential_savings', 0)
        
        if potential_savings > 100:  # $100+ savings threshold
            
            # Create alert for high-value opportunities
            alert_data = {
                'project_id': message_data.get('project_id'),
                'savings_potential': potential_savings,
                'recommendations_count': message_data.get('recommendations_count', 0),
                'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                'alert_type': 'high_value_optimization'
            }
            
            # Send Slack notification if webhook configured
            if webhook_url:

       --schedule="0 9 * * *" \
       --time-zone="America/New_York" \
       --topic=${TOPIC_NAME} \
       --message-body='{"trigger":"scheduled_analysis","type":"daily"}' \
       --description="Daily cost analysis across all projects"
   
   # Create weekly comprehensive analysis
   gcloud scheduler jobs create pubsub weekly-cost-report \
       --schedule="0 8 * * 1" \
       --time-zone="America/New_York" \
       --topic=${TOPIC_NAME} \
       --message-body='{"trigger":"weekly_report","type":"comprehensive"}' \
       --description="Weekly comprehensive cost optimization report"
   
   # Create monthly optimization review
   gcloud scheduler jobs create pubsub monthly-optimization-review \
       --schedule="0 7 1 * *" \
       --time-zone="America/New_York" \
       --topic=${TOPIC_NAME} \
       --message-body='{"trigger":"monthly_review","type":"optimization"}' \
       --description="Monthly optimization opportunities review"
   
   echo "✅ Scheduled jobs created for automated cost analysis"
   ```

   The scheduling system now automatically triggers cost analysis workflows at regular intervals, ensuring continuous monitoring and optimization without manual intervention while providing predictable reporting cadences for business stakeholders.

## Discussion

This intelligent cost optimization system demonstrates the power of combining Google Cloud's native cost management services with serverless automation. The Cloud Billing API provides comprehensive access to billing data across multiple projects, while Cloud Recommender delivers machine learning-powered optimization suggestions based on actual usage patterns. The event-driven architecture using Pub/Sub ensures scalable, reliable processing of cost events without infrastructure overhead.

The system's strength lies in its automated approach to cost optimization, moving beyond manual analysis to continuous monitoring and proactive recommendations. BigQuery's serverless data warehouse capabilities enable complex cost trend analysis and forecasting, while Cloud Functions provide cost-effective execution of optimization logic with the latest Python 3.12 runtime for enhanced performance and security. The integration with Cloud Scheduler ensures regular analysis without manual intervention, making cost optimization a continuous, automated process rather than a periodic manual task.

The architecture follows Google Cloud best practices for serverless applications, with proper error handling, monitoring, and security controls. The use of managed services minimizes operational overhead while providing enterprise-grade reliability and scalability. Organizations can expect 15-25% cost savings through automated optimization, with some customers achieving higher savings through committed use discount optimization and idle resource cleanup. The improved error handling and multiple recommender types provide more comprehensive coverage of optimization opportunities.

> **Tip**: Implement gradual rollout of automated optimizations, starting with low-risk recommendations like idle resource cleanup before enabling automated rightsizing or committed use discount purchases.

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the [Google Cloud FinOps Hub documentation](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/finops-hub), [Cloud Recommender best practices](https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/overview), [Cloud Billing API reference](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/reference/rest), and [Cost optimization strategies](https://cloud.google.com/docs/costs-usage). The [Google Cloud Architecture Center](https://cloud.google.com/architecture) provides additional patterns for implementing FinOps at scale.

## Challenge

Extend this solution by implementing these enhancements:

1. **Multi-Cloud Cost Integration**: Integrate AWS Cost Management and Azure Cost Management APIs to provide unified cost optimization across multiple cloud providers, enabling true multi-cloud FinOps capabilities with standardized reporting and alerting.

2. **Advanced ML-Powered Forecasting**: Implement custom machine learning models using Vertex AI to predict cost trends, detect anomalies, and optimize committed use discount purchases based on historical usage patterns and business growth projections.

3. **Automated Rightsizing with Safety Controls**: Develop intelligent rightsizing automation that analyzes resource utilization patterns and automatically applies safe optimizations during maintenance windows with rollback capabilities and approval workflows.

4. **Custom Recommendation Engine**: Build domain-specific recommendation algorithms that consider business context, compliance requirements, and operational constraints to provide more targeted optimization suggestions than generic cloud recommendations.

5. **Real-Time Cost Anomaly Detection**: Implement streaming cost analysis using Cloud Dataflow to detect cost anomalies in real-time and trigger immediate alerts or automated responses to prevent cost overruns before they impact monthly budgets.
