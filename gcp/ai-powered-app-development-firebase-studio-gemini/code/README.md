# Infrastructure as Code for AI-Powered App Development with Firebase Studio and Gemini

This directory contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementations for the recipe "AI-Powered App Development with Firebase Studio and Gemini".

## Available Implementations

- **Infrastructure Manager**: Google Cloud native infrastructure as code (YAML)
- **Terraform**: Multi-cloud infrastructure as code
- **Scripts**: Bash deployment and cleanup scripts

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud CLI (gcloud) installed and configured
- Firebase CLI installed and authenticated
- GitHub account for App Hosting repository integration
- Modern web browser for Firebase Studio access
- Appropriate GCP permissions for resource creation:
  - Firebase Admin
  - Project Editor or Owner
  - Secret Manager Admin
  - Cloud Build Editor
  - Cloud Run Admin

## Quick Start

### Using Infrastructure Manager (GCP)

```bash
# Navigate to Infrastructure Manager directory
cd infrastructure-manager/

# Create deployment
gcloud infra-manager deployments apply projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/deployments/ai-app-deployment \
    --service-account PROJECT_ID@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --local-source="." \
    --inputs-file="main.yaml"

# Monitor deployment status
gcloud infra-manager deployments describe projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/deployments/ai-app-deployment
```

### Using Terraform

```bash
# Navigate to Terraform directory
cd terraform/

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review planned changes
terraform plan -var="project_id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID" -var="region=us-central1"

# Apply infrastructure
terraform apply -var="project_id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID" -var="region=us-central1"

# View outputs
terraform output
```

### Using Bash Scripts

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh scripts/destroy.sh

# Set required environment variables
export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export REGION="us-central1"

# Deploy infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Verify deployment
gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID
gcloud firestore databases list --project=$PROJECT_ID
```

## Architecture Overview

This infrastructure creates:

- **Firebase Project**: Complete Firebase project with required APIs enabled
- **Firestore Database**: NoSQL document database in native mode
- **Firebase Authentication**: Multi-provider authentication service
- **Secret Manager**: Secure storage for Gemini API keys
- **App Hosting**: Automated deployment pipeline with GitHub integration
- **Cloud Build**: CI/CD automation for continuous deployment
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege service accounts and permissions

## Configuration Options

### Infrastructure Manager Variables

Edit the `main.yaml` file to customize:

```yaml
project_id: "your-project-id"
region: "us-central1"
app_name: "ai-task-manager"
enable_apis:
  - firebase.googleapis.com
  - firestore.googleapis.com
  - cloudbuild.googleapis.com
  - run.googleapis.com
  - secretmanager.googleapis.com
```

### Terraform Variables

Customize deployment in `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
project_id = "your-project-id"
region     = "us-central1"
app_name   = "ai-task-manager"

# Firebase configuration
firestore_location_id = "us-central"
auth_providers = [
  "google.com",
  "password",
  "github.com"
]

# App Hosting configuration
github_repository = "your-username/your-repo"
build_config = {
  runtime     = "nodejs18"
  entry_point = "npm start"
}
```

### Script Variables

Set environment variables before running scripts:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export REGION="us-central1"
export APP_NAME="ai-task-manager"
export GITHUB_REPO="your-username/your-repo"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

## Post-Deployment Steps

After infrastructure deployment, complete these manual steps:

1. **Access Firebase Studio**:
   ```bash
   echo "üåê Firebase Studio: https://studio.firebase.google.com"
   echo "üìã Select project: $PROJECT_ID"
   ```

2. **Configure Authentication Providers**:
   - Navigate to Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable desired providers (Google, Email/Password, GitHub)
   - Configure OAuth settings for external providers

3. **Connect GitHub Repository**:
   - Access Firebase Console > App Hosting
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure build settings and environment variables

4. **Set up Gemini API Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Update Secret Manager with your Gemini API key
   echo "your-actual-gemini-api-key" | \
       gcloud secrets versions add gemini-api-key --data-file=-
   ```

5. **Configure Firestore Security Rules**:
   - Review and update security rules in Firebase Console
   - Test rules with Firebase Emulator Suite

## Cleanup

### Using Infrastructure Manager (GCP)

```bash
# Delete deployment
gcloud infra-manager deployments delete projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/deployments/ai-app-deployment \
    --delete-policy=DELETE

# Verify deletion
gcloud infra-manager deployments list --location=REGION
```

### Using Terraform

```bash
# Navigate to Terraform directory
cd terraform/

# Destroy infrastructure
terraform destroy -var="project_id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID" -var="region=us-central1"

# Clean up state files (optional)
rm -f terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup
```

### Using Bash Scripts

```bash
# Run cleanup script
./scripts/destroy.sh

# Verify cleanup
gcloud projects list --filter="projectId:$PROJECT_ID"

# Optionally delete the entire project
gcloud projects delete $PROJECT_ID --quiet
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   - Use Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing
   - Access Firebase Studio for AI-assisted development
   - Leverage Gemini integration for code generation

2. **Version Control**:
   - Connect GitHub repository for App Hosting
   - Configure automated deployments on push
   - Use Firebase preview channels for staging

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploy through App Hosting automated pipeline
   - Monitor with Firebase Performance Monitoring
   - Scale automatically with Cloud Run backend

## Monitoring and Observability

Access monitoring dashboards:

```bash
# Firebase Console
echo "üìä Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/$PROJECT_ID"

# Cloud Console
echo "üîç Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=$PROJECT_ID"

# App Hosting metrics
echo "üöÄ App Hosting: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/$PROJECT_ID/hosting"
```

## Cost Optimization

- **Firebase Free Tier**: Most development activities use free tier
- **Firestore**: Pay-per-operation pricing with generous free quotas
- **App Hosting**: Based on Cloud Run usage with automatic scaling
- **Cloud Build**: 120 free build minutes per day
- **Secret Manager**: Minimal cost for API key storage

Estimated monthly cost for development: $2-5 USD

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Not Enabled Error**:
   ```bash
   # Enable required APIs
   gcloud services enable firebase.googleapis.com firestore.googleapis.com
   ```

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Re-authenticate Firebase CLI
   firebase logout
   firebase login --no-localhost
   ```

3. **Project Creation Failures**:
   ```bash
   # Check project quotas and billing
   gcloud alpha billing projects describe $PROJECT_ID
   ```

4. **App Hosting Connection Issues**:
   - Verify GitHub repository access
   - Check OAuth app permissions
   - Review build configuration

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check project status
gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID

# Verify enabled services
gcloud services list --enabled --project=$PROJECT_ID

# Check Firestore status
gcloud firestore databases list --project=$PROJECT_ID

# View recent operations
gcloud firestore operations list --project=$PROJECT_ID

# Check Secret Manager
gcloud secrets list --project=$PROJECT_ID
```

## Security Considerations

- **IAM**: Minimal required permissions configured
- **Firestore Rules**: User-based data access controls
- **Secret Manager**: Secure API key storage with encryption
- **App Hosting**: Automatic SSL/TLS certificates
- **Authentication**: Multi-provider security with rate limiting
