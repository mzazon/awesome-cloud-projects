```

## Steps

1. **Configure Cloud KMS for Encryption**:

   Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) provides centralized cryptographic key management with hardware security modules (HSMs) and automatic key rotation. This managed service ensures that encryption keys are protected according to FIPS 140-2 Level 3 standards, meeting the highest compliance requirements while integrating seamlessly with other Google Cloud services for comprehensive data protection.

   ```bash
   # Create KMS keyring for secret encryption
   gcloud kms keyrings create secure-dev-keyring \
       --location=${REGION}
   
   # Create encryption key for secrets
   gcloud kms keys create secret-encryption-key \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --keyring=secure-dev-keyring \
       --purpose=encryption
   
   # Verify key creation
   gcloud kms keys list \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --keyring=secure-dev-keyring
   
   echo "✅ KMS encryption infrastructure established"
   ```

   The encryption key is now available for protecting sensitive data across your Google Cloud resources. This cryptographic foundation enables data-at-rest encryption, application-level encryption, and secure key rotation, providing enterprise-grade security that scales with your infrastructure needs.

2. **Set Up Cloud Secrets Manager with Encryption**:

   Cloud Secrets Manager provides a secure and convenient method for storing and accessing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and certificates. By integrating with Cloud KMS, it ensures that secrets are encrypted both at rest and in transit, while providing fine-grained access controls through Cloud IAM for compliance with zero-trust security principles.

   ```bash
   # Create secrets for development environment
   echo "database-connection-string" | \
       gcloud secrets create ${SECRET_NAME}-db \
       --replication-policy="automatic" \
       --data-file=-
   
   echo "api-key-for-external-service" | \
       gcloud secrets create ${SECRET_NAME}-api \
       --replication-policy="automatic" \
       --data-file=-
   
   # Create service account for application access
   gcloud iam service-accounts create secure-app-sa \
       --display-name="Secure Application Service Account" \
       --description="Service account for secure development application"
   
   # Grant secret access permissions
   gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding ${SECRET_NAME}-db \
       --member="serviceAccount:secure-app-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
   
   gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding ${SECRET_NAME}-api \
       --member="serviceAccount:secure-app-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
   
   echo "✅ Secrets configured with proper access controls"
   ```

   The secrets infrastructure is now operational with service account-based access controls. This configuration ensures that sensitive credentials are never exposed in code or configuration files, supporting secure development practices and enabling seamless integration with both Cloud Run services and Cloud Workstations.

3. **Create Secure Cloud Workstation Configuration**:

   Cloud Workstations provides fully managed, cloud-based development environments that integrate seamlessly with Google Cloud security services. By configuring workstations with Cloud IAP protection and Gemini Code Assist integration, developers gain access to powerful, secure development environments that maintain zero-trust principles while providing AI-enhanced productivity.

   ```bash
   # Create workstation cluster
   gcloud workstations clusters create secure-dev-cluster \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --network="projects/${PROJECT_ID}/global/networks/default" \
       --subnetwork="projects/${PROJECT_ID}/regions/${REGION}/subnetworks/default"
   
   # Wait for cluster creation to complete
   echo "Waiting for workstation cluster creation..."
   gcloud workstations clusters describe secure-dev-cluster \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --format="value(state)"
   sleep 60
   
   # Create workstation configuration with security features
   gcloud workstations configs create secure-dev-config \
       --cluster=secure-dev-cluster \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --machine-type=e2-standard-4 \
       --pd-disk-type=pd-standard \
       --pd-disk-size=100GB \
       --container-image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest \
       --service-account=secure-app-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
       --enable-ip-alias
   
   # Create the actual workstation instance
   gcloud workstations create ${WORKSTATION_NAME} \
       --cluster=secure-dev-cluster \
       --config=secure-dev-config \
       --region=${REGION}
   
   echo "✅ Secure Cloud Workstation created and configured"
   ```

   The workstation environment is now ready with integrated security controls and AI assistance. This setup provides developers with a consistent, secure development environment that includes pre-configured access to Google Cloud services, integrated secret management, and Gemini Code Assist for enhanced productivity.

4. **Deploy Sample Application to Cloud Run**:

   Cloud Run provides a serverless platform for containerized applications with built-in security features and seamless integration with Google Cloud services. This deployment demonstrates how applications can securely access secrets while being protected by Cloud IAP, creating a complete zero-trust application architecture.

   ```bash
   # Create sample application code
   mkdir -p secure-app/src
   
   cat > secure-app/src/main.py << 'EOF'
import os
from google.cloud import secretmanager
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def get_secret(secret_name):
    """Retrieve secret from Google Cloud Secret Manager"""
    try:
        client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
        project_id = os.environ.get('GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT')
        name = f"projects/{project_id}/secrets/{secret_name}/versions/latest"
        response = client.access_secret_version(request={"name": name})
        return response.payload.data.decode('UTF-8')
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error accessing secret {secret_name}: {e}")
        return None

@app.route('/health')
def health_check():
    """Health check endpoint"""
    return jsonify({"status": "healthy", "service": "secure-dev-app"}), 200

@app.route('/api/config')
def get_config():
    """API endpoint that demonstrates secure secret access"""
    # This would typically be used for database connections, API keys, etc.
    db_secret = get_secret(os.environ.get('DB_SECRET_NAME'))
    api_secret = get_secret(os.environ.get('API_SECRET_NAME'))
    
    return jsonify({
        "message": "Configuration loaded securely",
        "db_connected": bool(db_secret),
        "api_configured": bool(api_secret),
        "environment": "secure"
    }), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080)))
EOF

   # Create Dockerfile with security best practices
   cat > secure-app/Dockerfile << 'EOF'
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

EOF

   # Deploy to Cloud Run with security configurations
   cd secure-app
   gcloud run deploy ${APP_NAME} \
       --source . \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --service-account=secure-app-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
       --set-env-vars="DB_SECRET_NAME=${SECRET_NAME}-db,API_SECRET_NAME=${SECRET_NAME}-api" \
       --no-allow-unauthenticated \
       --max-instances=10 \
       --memory=512Mi \
       --cpu=1 \
       --port=8080 \
       --execution-environment=gen2
   
   cd ..
   
   echo "✅ Secure application deployed to Cloud Run"
   ```

   The application is now deployed with secure secret access and authentication requirements. This demonstrates how Cloud Run services can securely retrieve sensitive configuration data without exposing credentials in code or environment variables, while requiring authentication for all requests.

5. **Configure Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**:

   Cloud IAP establishes a central authorization layer that enables zero-trust access control for applications and resources. By implementing OAuth 2.0-based authentication and fine-grained IAM policies, IAP ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources while eliminating the need for traditional VPN connections and network-level security controls.

   ```bash
   # Get the Cloud Run service URL
   SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe ${APP_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --format="value(status.url)")
   
   # Create OAuth consent screen (if not already configured)
   gcloud iap oauth-brands create \
       --application_title="Secure Development Environment" \
       --support_email=$(gcloud config get-value account) || \
       echo "OAuth brand may already exist"
   
   # Enable IAP for Cloud Run service
   gcloud run services update ${APP_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --set-env-vars="IAP_ENABLED=true"
   
   # Configure IAP access policy for current user
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="user:$(gcloud config get-value account)" \
       --role="roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"
   
   # Example: Add developer team members (uncomment and modify as needed)
   # gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
   #     --member="user:developer@company.com" \
   #     --role="roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy configured"
   echo "Service URL: ${SERVICE_URL}"
   ```

   Cloud IAP is now protecting your application with zero-trust access controls. Users must authenticate through Google OAuth 2.0 and be granted explicit IAM permissions before accessing the application, ensuring that every request is verified regardless of network location or device used.

6. **Set Up Cloud Build for Secure CI/CD**:

   Cloud Build provides a fully managed continuous integration and continuous deployment platform that integrates seamlessly with Google Cloud security services. By configuring Cloud Build with proper IAM controls and secret management, development teams can maintain secure, automated deployment pipelines that follow zero-trust principles.

  _IMAGE: secure-dev-app
  _SERVICE_NAME: ${APP_NAME}
  _REGION: us-central1
  _SERVICE_ACCOUNT: secure-app-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com

options:
  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
  substitution_option: 'ALLOW_LOOSE'
EOF

   # Grant Cloud Build necessary permissions
   PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --format="value(projectNumber)")
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/run.developer"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/artifactregistry.writer"
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Build CI/CD pipeline configured"
   ```

   The CI/CD pipeline is now established with proper security controls and automated deployment capabilities. This configuration enables developers to commit code changes that trigger secure, automated builds and deployments while maintaining access control and audit trails throughout the entire process.

       --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
   
   # Update Cloud Workstation configuration for Gemini integration
   gcloud workstations configs update secure-dev-config \
       --cluster=secure-dev-cluster \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --container-env="GEMINI_CODE_ASSIST_ENABLED=true,GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${PROJECT_ID}"
   
   # Restart workstation to apply changes
   gcloud workstations stop ${WORKSTATION_NAME} \
       --cluster=secure-dev-cluster \
       --config=secure-dev-config \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --async
   
   # Wait for workstation to stop
   echo "Waiting for workstation to stop..."
   sleep 60
   
   gcloud workstations start ${WORKSTATION_NAME} \
       --cluster=secure-dev-cluster \
       --config=secure-dev-config \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --async
   
   echo "✅ Gemini Code Assist integration configured"

## Discussion

This recipe demonstrates how to implement a comprehensive zero-trust development environment that combines security best practices with AI-enhanced productivity. The solution addresses the growing need for secure development workflows that protect sensitive resources while enabling modern development practices. By leveraging Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy, organizations can eliminate traditional VPN-based access controls and implement fine-grained, context-aware authentication that verifies every request regardless of network location.

The integration of Gemini Code Assist with secure development environments represents a significant advancement in balancing security with developer productivity. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that may expose proprietary code to external services, Gemini Code Assist Enterprise provides AI assistance while maintaining data governance controls and enterprise-grade security. This approach enables developers to benefit from intelligent code suggestions, automated testing recommendations, and security best practices without compromising intellectual property or introducing compliance risks. The AI assistance operates within the secure boundary established by Cloud IAP and integrates seamlessly with Google Cloud's security model.

Cloud Secrets Manager plays a crucial role in this architecture by ensuring that sensitive credentials never appear in code repositories or configuration files. The integration with Cloud KMS provides an additional layer of encryption that meets compliance requirements for highly regulated industries. This approach supports the principle of least privilege by granting applications access only to the specific secrets they require, while maintaining detailed audit logs of all secret access patterns. The combination with Cloud Build creates secure CI/CD pipelines that can access secrets during deployment without exposing them to developers or storing them in build artifacts.

The architectural pattern established in this recipe scales effectively across enterprise development teams and can be extended to support multiple environments, applications, and deployment targets. Organizations can adapt this approach to implement consistent security controls across their entire development lifecycle, from initial code creation through production deployment. The zero-trust principles demonstrated here align with modern security frameworks and regulatory compliance requirements, making this solution suitable for organizations in financial services, healthcare, and other highly regulated sectors. For comprehensive guidance on implementing zero-trust architectures, refer to the [Google Cloud Zero Trust Security Model](https://cloud.google.com/security/zero-trust) documentation.

> **Tip**: Consider implementing Cloud Security Command Center to gain centralized visibility into security findings across your development environment, enabling proactive threat detection and compliance monitoring.

## Challenge

Extend this solution by implementing these enhancements:

1. **Multi-Environment Deployment Pipeline**: Create separate development, staging, and production environments with environment-specific secret management and automated promotion pipelines using Cloud Deploy and Terraform for infrastructure as code.

2. **Advanced Monitoring and Alerting**: Integrate Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, and Cloud Security Command Center to create comprehensive observability dashboards that track developer activity, AI assistance usage patterns, and security policy violations.

3. **Dynamic Access Controls**: Implement time-based access controls and just-in-time (JIT) access for production resources using Cloud IAM Conditions and Cloud Workflows to automate approval processes based on business hours and project requirements.

4. **Custom Gemini Code Assist Training**: Configure Gemini Code Assist Enterprise with your organization's private code repositories and coding standards to provide contextually relevant suggestions that align with internal best practices and architectural patterns.

5. **Compliance Automation**: Extend the solution with Cloud Asset Inventory, Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and custom organization policies to automatically detect and remediate compliance violations while maintaining detailed audit trails for regulatory reporting.
