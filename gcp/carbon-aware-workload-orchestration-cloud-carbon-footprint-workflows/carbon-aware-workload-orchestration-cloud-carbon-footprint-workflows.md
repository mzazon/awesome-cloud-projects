# Developing Carbon-Aware Workload Orchestration with Cloud Carbon Footprint and Cloud Workflows

## Problem

Organizations running compute-intensive workloads in the cloud face increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Traditional workload scheduling approaches ignore carbon emissions data, leading to unnecessary environmental impact when compute tasks run during periods of high carbon intensity. Without intelligent orchestration based on real-time carbon footprint metrics, companies struggle to meet sustainability goals while ensuring performance requirements are met for business-critical operations.

## Solution

Build an intelligent workload orchestration system that leverages Google Cloud's Carbon Footprint APIs and Cloud Workflows to automatically schedule compute-intensive tasks during periods of low carbon emissions. This solution combines carbon footprint data analysis through BigQuery with automated workflow orchestration to optimize workload timing based on both carbon intensity and business requirements. The system provides real-time carbon awareness while maintaining flexibility for urgent workloads and delivers measurable environmental impact reduction.

export INSTANCE_TEMPLATE="carbon-aware-template-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable workflows.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable bigquerydatatransfer.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudscheduler.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable logging.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com

# Create BigQuery dataset for carbon footprint data
bq mk --location=${REGION} ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ BigQuery dataset created: ${DATASET_NAME}"
```

## Steps

1. **Set Up Carbon Footprint Data Export to BigQuery**:

   Google Cloud's Carbon Footprint service provides detailed emissions data for your cloud usage through the BigQuery Data Transfer Service. The export automatically delivers carbon footprint metrics to BigQuery, creating a foundation for carbon-aware automation that scales with your infrastructure growth and provides historical data for trend analysis.

   ```bash
   # Create a service account for data transfer operations
   gcloud iam service-accounts create carbon-footprint-sa \
       --display-name="Carbon Footprint Data Transfer Service Account" \
       --description="Service account for automated carbon footprint data exports"
   
   # Grant necessary permissions for BigQuery data transfer
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:carbon-footprint-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/bigquery.dataTransfer.serviceAgent"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:carbon-footprint-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/bigquery.dataEditor"
   
   # Create Carbon Footprint export using BigQuery Data Transfer Service
   # Note: In production, you would configure the actual transfer using the REST API
   # This creates the foundation for the data export
   bq mk --transfer_config \
       --project_id=${PROJECT_ID} \
       --data_source=61cede5a-0000-2440-ad42-883d24f8f7b8 \
       --display_name="Carbon Footprint Export" \
       --target_dataset=${DATASET_NAME} \
       --params='{"billing_accounts":["'${PROJECT_ID}'"]}'
   
   echo "✅ Carbon footprint data export service account configured"
   echo "✅ Carbon footprint transfer configuration created"
   ```

   The service account now has appropriate permissions to automatically export carbon footprint data to BigQuery, enabling continuous carbon metrics collection. This establishes the data foundation needed for intelligent workload scheduling decisions based on real-time environmental impact.

2. **Create BigQuery Views for Carbon Intensity Analysis**:

   BigQuery views enable sophisticated analysis of carbon footprint data, transforming raw emissions metrics into actionable insights for workload orchestration. These views calculate carbon intensity trends, identify optimal scheduling windows, and provide the analytical foundation for automated decision-making that balances environmental impact with operational requirements.

   ```bash
   # Create view for hourly carbon intensity analysis
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
   "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.hourly_carbon_intensity\` AS
   SELECT
     EXTRACT(HOUR FROM usage_month) as hour_of_day,
     EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM usage_month) as day_of_week,
     region,
     AVG(carbon_footprint_total_kgCO2e) as avg_carbon_intensity,
     COUNT(*) as sample_count,
     STDDEV(carbon_footprint_total_kgCO2e) as carbon_variance
   FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.carbon_footprint\`
   WHERE usage_month >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
   GROUP BY hour_of_day, day_of_week, region
   ORDER BY avg_carbon_intensity ASC"
   
   # Create view for optimal scheduling recommendations
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
   "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.optimal_scheduling_windows\` AS
   SELECT
     hour_of_day,
     day_of_week,
     region,
     avg_carbon_intensity,
     CASE 
       WHEN avg_carbon_intensity < (SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(avg_carbon_intensity, 0.25) OVER() FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.hourly_carbon_intensity\`) THEN 'GREEN'
       WHEN avg_carbon_intensity < (SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(avg_carbon_intensity, 0.75) OVER() FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.hourly_carbon_intensity\`) THEN 'YELLOW'
       ELSE 'RED'
     END as carbon_tier
   FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.hourly_carbon_intensity\`
   WHERE sample_count > 5"
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery views created for carbon intensity analysis"
   ```

   The analytical views now provide carbon intensity classifications and optimal scheduling recommendations based on historical data patterns. This intelligence layer enables the workflow orchestration system to make informed decisions about when to schedule workloads for minimal environmental impact.

3. **Create Cloud Function for Carbon-Aware Scheduling Logic**:

   Cloud Functions provide serverless execution for carbon-aware scheduling decisions, analyzing real-time carbon intensity data and implementing intelligent workload placement logic. This function serves as the decision engine that evaluates carbon footprint metrics against business requirements to determine optimal execution timing and resource allocation.

   ```bash
   # Create directory for Cloud Function source code
   mkdir -p cloud-function-source
   cd cloud-function-source

        publish_scheduling_decision(decision)
        
        return json.dumps(decision)
        
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in carbon-aware scheduling: {str(e)}")

        delay_hours = calculate_optimal_delay(carbon_intensity)

    if carbon_intensity['tier'] == 'RED':

    return 2  # Wait 2 hours for moderate improvement

def publish_scheduling_decision(decision):
    """Publish scheduling decision to Pub/Sub for workflow consumption"""
    topic_path = publisher.topic_path(bq_client.project, 'carbon-aware-decisions')

   cd ..
   
   echo "✅ Carbon-aware scheduling Cloud Function deployed"
   ```

   The Cloud Function now provides intelligent carbon-aware scheduling capabilities, analyzing real-time carbon intensity data and making optimal workload placement decisions. This serverless decision engine balances environmental impact with business requirements, enabling automated sustainability optimization across your compute infrastructure.

4. **Create Pub/Sub Topic for Workflow Communication**:

   Google Cloud Pub/Sub enables reliable, asynchronous communication between the carbon-aware scheduling function and workflow orchestration system. This messaging foundation ensures that scheduling decisions are reliably delivered and processed, providing the coordination layer needed for complex multi-step carbon-aware automation workflows.

   ```bash
   # Create Pub/Sub topic for carbon-aware scheduling decisions
   gcloud pubsub topics create carbon-aware-decisions
   
   # Create subscription for workflow consumption
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create carbon-aware-workflow-sub \
       --topic=carbon-aware-decisions \
       --ack-deadline=60
   
   # Create topic for workload execution status updates
   gcloud pubsub topics create workload-execution-status
   
   # Create subscription for monitoring workload status
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create workload-status-monitoring \
       --topic=workload-execution-status \
       --ack-deadline=300
   
   echo "✅ Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions created for workflow communication"
   ```

   The messaging infrastructure now supports reliable communication between carbon-aware scheduling decisions and workload execution, enabling robust orchestration workflows that can handle both immediate execution and delayed scheduling scenarios based on environmental conditions.

5. **Create Cloud Workflows Definition for Orchestration**:

   Cloud Workflows provides serverless orchestration for complex carbon-aware scheduling logic, coordinating between carbon footprint analysis, business requirements evaluation, and workload execution. This workflow definition implements sophisticated decision trees that optimize for both environmental impact and operational efficiency while providing comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create workflow definition file
   cat > carbon-aware-workflow.yaml << 'EOF'
main:
  params: [args]
  steps:
    - initialize:
        assign:

## Discussion

This carbon-aware workload orchestration system demonstrates how modern cloud platforms can integrate environmental sustainability directly into operational workflows without sacrificing performance or reliability. By leveraging Google Cloud's Carbon Footprint APIs and serverless orchestration capabilities, organizations can achieve measurable reductions in their compute-related carbon emissions while maintaining operational excellence and cost efficiency.

The architecture combines several key Google Cloud services to create an intelligent scheduling system that considers both carbon intensity and business requirements. Cloud Workflows provides the orchestration backbone, enabling complex decision trees that balance environmental impact with operational needs. The BigQuery integration allows for sophisticated analysis of historical carbon footprint data, identifying patterns and optimal scheduling windows that can significantly reduce overall emissions. Cloud Functions deliver the real-time decision-making capabilities needed to evaluate current conditions and make intelligent scheduling choices.

The system's flexibility is particularly valuable for organizations with diverse workload requirements. Critical business processes can override carbon optimization when necessary, while batch processing and analytical workloads can be optimally scheduled during periods of low carbon intensity. This approach ensures that sustainability initiatives don't compromise business continuity while still delivering meaningful environmental benefits. The monitoring and alerting capabilities provide continuous visibility into both environmental impact and operational performance, enabling organizations to demonstrate progress toward sustainability goals while maintaining operational excellence.

Real-world implementations of this pattern have shown carbon emission reductions of 15-30% for batch processing workloads, with minimal impact on overall completion times. The key to success lies in understanding your workload characteristics and setting appropriate delay tolerances that balance environmental benefits with business requirements. For more information on Google Cloud's sustainability initiatives, see the [Google Cloud Carbon Footprint documentation](https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint/docs), [Google Cloud Architecture Framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework), and [Sustainable Cloud Architecture best practices](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/sustainable-cloud-architecture).

> **Tip**: Start with non-critical batch workloads to validate your carbon-aware scheduling approach before expanding to more time-sensitive operations. Monitor both carbon emission reductions and workload completion times to optimize delay tolerances and scheduling algorithms based on your specific business requirements and sustainability goals.

## Challenge

Extend this carbon-aware workload orchestration system with these advanced enhancements:

1. **Implement predictive carbon intensity modeling** using Vertex AI to forecast optimal execution windows based on historical patterns, weather data, and grid energy sources, enabling proactive scheduling decisions that consider future carbon conditions rather than just current state.

2. **Add multi-region carbon optimization** that automatically selects the Google Cloud region with the lowest current carbon intensity for executing workloads, balancing data residency requirements with environmental impact while considering network latency and compliance constraints.

3. **Integrate with Google Cloud Batch** to enable large-scale parallel job processing with carbon-aware scheduling, implementing intelligent job queuing that considers both resource availability and carbon intensity to optimize the environmental impact of high-performance computing workloads.

4. **Create a carbon budget management system** that tracks cumulative carbon emissions against organizational sustainability targets, implementing automatic workload throttling when carbon budgets are exceeded and providing executive dashboards showing progress toward net-zero goals.

5. **Develop carbon-aware auto-scaling policies** for Google Kubernetes Engine clusters that consider both resource demand and carbon intensity when making scaling decisions, minimizing environmental impact during peak usage periods while maintaining application performance and availability.
