## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled
2. Google Workspace domain with admin access for Events API configuration
3. gcloud CLI installed and configured (or Cloud Shell)
4. Domain-wide delegation configured for Workspace Events API access
5. Estimated cost: $10-25/month for processing 10,000 events daily

> **Note**: This recipe requires Google Workspace Business Standard or higher to access the Events API. Free personal Google accounts are not supported.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="workspace-analytics-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable firestore.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable workspaceevents.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"

# Create service account for Workspace Events API
gcloud iam service-accounts create workspace-events-sa \
    --display-name="Workspace Events Service Account"

# Grant necessary permissions
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --member="serviceAccount:workspace-events-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/pubsub.publisher"

echo "✅ Service account configured for Workspace Events API"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud Pub/Sub Topic for Workspace Events**:

   Cloud Pub/Sub serves as the reliable messaging backbone for Google Workspace events, providing asynchronous event delivery with guaranteed message ordering and automatic retry capabilities. This decoupled architecture ensures that workspace events are captured even during high-volume periods or temporary service disruptions.

   ```bash
   # Create Pub/Sub topic for workspace events
   gcloud pubsub topics create workspace-events-topic
   
   # Create subscription for Cloud Functions trigger
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create workspace-events-subscription \
       --topic=workspace-events-topic \
       --ack-deadline=600
   
   echo "✅ Pub/Sub topic and subscription created"
   ```

   The topic configuration includes extended acknowledgment deadlines to accommodate complex event processing workflows while maintaining message delivery guarantees across distributed systems.

2. **Initialize Cloud Firestore Database**:

   Cloud Firestore provides real-time NoSQL storage optimized for collaborative applications, offering automatic scaling and real-time synchronization capabilities essential for team analytics dashboards. The document-based structure aligns perfectly with the flexible schema requirements of workspace event data.

   ```bash
   # Create Firestore database in native mode
   gcloud firestore databases create \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --type=firestore-native
   
   # Wait for database creation to complete
   echo "Waiting for Firestore database initialization..."
   sleep 30
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Firestore database initialized"
   ```

   Native mode Firestore provides strong consistency guarantees and real-time listeners, enabling immediate dashboard updates as collaboration events are processed and stored.

3. **Deploy Event Processing Cloud Function**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless event processing that automatically scales based on incoming Workspace events, eliminating infrastructure management while ensuring cost-effective processing. The function transforms raw event data into structured analytics insights for team collaboration patterns.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Function source directory
   mkdir -p workspace-analytics-function
   cd workspace-analytics-function
   
   # Create main function file
   cat > main.py << 'EOF'
import json
import base64
from google.cloud import firestore
from datetime import datetime
import functions_framework

db = firestore.Client()

@functions_framework.cloud_event
def process_workspace_event(cloud_event):
    """Process Google Workspace events and store analytics data."""
    
    try:
        # Decode event data
        event_data = json.loads(base64.b64decode(cloud_event.data['message']['data']))
        event_type = cloud_event.data['message']['attributes'].get('ce-type', '')
        event_time = cloud_event.data['message']['attributes'].get('ce-time', '')
        
        # Extract collaboration insights
        insights = extract_collaboration_insights(event_data, event_type)
        
        # Store in Firestore
        doc_ref = db.collection('collaboration_events').document()
        doc_ref.set({
            'event_type': event_type,
            'timestamp': datetime.fromisoformat(event_time.replace('Z', '+00:00')),
            'insights': insights,
            'raw_event': event_data
        })
        
        # Update team metrics
        update_team_metrics(insights)
        
        print(f"Processed {event_type} event at {event_time}")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing event: {str(e)}")
        raise

def extract_collaboration_insights(event_data, event_type):
    """Extract meaningful collaboration insights from workspace events."""
    insights = {}
    
    if 'chat.message' in event_type:
        insights.update({
            'interaction_type': 'chat',
            'participants': event_data.get('sender', {}).get('name'),
            'space_id': event_data.get('space', {}).get('name')
        })
    elif 'drive.file' in event_type:
        insights.update({
            'interaction_type': 'file_collaboration',
            'file_type': event_data.get('mimeType'),
            'sharing_activity': event_type.split('.')[-1]
        })
    elif 'meet.conference' in event_type:
        insights.update({
            'interaction_type': 'meeting',
            'duration': event_data.get('conferenceRecord', {}).get('duration'),
            'participants_count': len(event_data.get('participants', []))
        })
    
    return insights

def update_team_metrics(insights):
    """Update aggregated team collaboration metrics."""
    metrics_ref = db.collection('team_metrics').document('daily_summary')
    
    # Use Firestore transactions for atomic updates
    from google.cloud.firestore import Increment
    
    try:
        metrics_ref.update({
            f"{insights.get('interaction_type', 'unknown')}_count": Increment(1),
            'last_updated': datetime.now()
        })
    except Exception as e:
        # Document may not exist, create it
        metrics_ref.set({
            f"{insights.get('interaction_type', 'unknown')}_count": 1,
            'last_updated': datetime.now()
        })

       --set-env-vars "GCP_PROJECT=${PROJECT_ID}"
   
   cd ..
   echo "✅ Cloud Function deployed successfully"
   ```

   The Cloud Function implementation includes intelligent event parsing, collaboration pattern recognition, and atomic metric updates using Firestore transactions to ensure data consistency across concurrent event processing.

4. **Create Workspace Events API Subscription**:

   The Workspace Events API subscription establishes real-time monitoring of Google Workspace resources, automatically delivering CloudEvents-formatted notifications to the Pub/Sub topic. This integration enables comprehensive tracking of team collaboration activities across all Workspace applications.

   ```bash
   # Create Workspace Events subscription for Chat events
   cat > chat-subscription.json << EOF
{
  "name": "projects/${PROJECT_ID}/subscriptions/chat-collaboration-events",
  "targetResource": "//chat.googleapis.com/spaces/-",
  "eventTypes": [
    "google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created",
    "google.workspace.chat.space.v1.updated",
    "google.workspace.chat.membership.v1.created"
  ],
  "notificationEndpoint": {
    "pubsubTopic": "projects/${PROJECT_ID}/topics/workspace-events-topic"
  },
  "payloadOptions": {
    "includeResource": true
  }
}
EOF
   
   # Create subscription using REST API
   curl -X POST \
     "https://workspaceevents.googleapis.com/v1/subscriptions" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @chat-subscription.json
   
   echo "✅ Workspace Events subscription created for Chat events"
   ```

   The subscription configuration includes resource data payloads for immediate analysis without additional API calls, optimizing both performance and cost efficiency for real-time collaboration insights.

5. **Configure Drive Events Monitoring**:

   Google Drive events provide crucial insights into file collaboration patterns, sharing behaviors, and document lifecycle management within teams. Monitoring these events reveals collaboration effectiveness and identifies potential security or compliance issues in real-time.

   ```bash
   # Create Drive events subscription
   cat > drive-subscription.json << EOF

    "google.workspace.drive.file.v1.created",
    "google.workspace.drive.file.v1.updated",
    "google.workspace.drive.file.v1.accessProposalCreated"
  ],
  "notificationEndpoint": {
    "pubsubTopic": "projects/${PROJECT_ID}/topics/workspace-events-topic"
  },
  "payloadOptions": {
    "includeResource": false
  }
}
EOF
   
   # Create Drive subscription
   curl -X POST \
     "https://workspaceevents.googleapis.com/v1/subscriptions" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @drive-subscription.json
   
   echo "✅ Drive collaboration events subscription configured"
   ```

   Drive event monitoring captures file creation, modification, and sharing activities, providing comprehensive visibility into document collaboration workflows and team productivity patterns.

6. **Set Up Meet Events Tracking**:

   Google Meet events offer valuable insights into meeting effectiveness, participation patterns, and virtual collaboration trends. This data enables organizations to optimize meeting culture and identify opportunities for improved team communication and productivity.

   ```bash
   # Create Meet events subscription
   cat > meet-subscription.json << EOF

db = firestore.Client()

@functions_framework.http
def get_collaboration_analytics(request):
    """HTTP endpoint for retrieving collaboration analytics."""
    
    try:
        # Parse query parameters
        days = int(request.args.get('days', 7))
        team_id = request.args.get('team_id', 'all')
        
        # Calculate date range
        end_date = datetime.now()
        start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=days)
        
        # Query collaboration events
        events_ref = db.collection('collaboration_events')
        query = events_ref.where('timestamp', '>=', start_date) \
                         .where('timestamp', '<=', end_date)
        
        events = []
        for doc in query.stream():
            event_data = doc.to_dict()
            events.append(event_data)
        
        # Calculate analytics
        analytics = calculate_team_analytics(events)
        
        return jsonify({
            'period': f'{days} days',
            'total_events': len(events),
            'analytics': analytics,
            'generated_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
        })
        
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

def calculate_team_analytics(events):
    """Calculate team collaboration analytics from events."""
    analytics = {
        'interaction_types': {},
        'daily_activity': {},
        'collaboration_score': 0
    }
    
    for event in events:
        # Count interaction types
        interaction_type = event.get('insights', {}).get('interaction_type', 'unknown')
        analytics['interaction_types'][interaction_type] = \
            analytics['interaction_types'].get(interaction_type, 0) + 1
        
        # Group by day
        event_date = event.get('timestamp').date().isoformat()
        analytics['daily_activity'][event_date] = \
            analytics['daily_activity'].get(event_date, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate collaboration score (simplified metric)
    total_interactions = sum(analytics['interaction_types'].values())
    unique_types = len(analytics['interaction_types'])
    analytics['collaboration_score'] = min(100, total_interactions * unique_types / 10)
    
    return analytics
EOF
   
   # Create requirements file
   cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
google-cloud-firestore>=2.16.0
functions-framework>=3.5.0
flask>=2.3.0
EOF
   
   # Deploy analytics dashboard function
   gcloud functions deploy collaboration-analytics \
       --runtime python312 \
       --trigger-http \
       --allow-unauthenticated \
       --source . \
       --entry-point get_collaboration_analytics \

8. **Configure Firestore Security Rules**:

   Firestore security rules ensure that collaboration analytics data is properly protected while enabling appropriate access for dashboard applications and administrative users. These rules implement principle of least privilege for sensitive team collaboration information.

   ```bash
   # Create Firestore security rules
   cat > firestore.rules << 'EOF'
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to collaboration events for authenticated users
    match /collaboration_events/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // Only Cloud Functions can write
    }
    
    // Allow read access to team metrics
    match /team_metrics/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // Only Cloud Functions can write
    }
    
    // Allow admin access for specific service accounts
    match /{path=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.token.email.matches('.*@' + resource.data.project_id + '.iam.gserviceaccount.com');
    }
  }
}
EOF
   
   # Deploy security rules
   gcloud firestore deploy --rules firestore.rules
   
   echo "✅ Firestore security rules configured"
   ```

   Security rules protect sensitive collaboration data while enabling legitimate access patterns for analytics processing and dashboard visualization functionality.
