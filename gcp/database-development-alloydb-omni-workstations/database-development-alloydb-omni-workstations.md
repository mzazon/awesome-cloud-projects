## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for the project
export PROJECT_ID="db-dev-workflows-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export CLUSTER_NAME="workstation-cluster-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export CONFIG_NAME="db-dev-config-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export REPO_NAME="database-development-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable workstations.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable sourcerepo.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable logging.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ Region set to: ${REGION}"
echo "✅ Required APIs enabled"
```

## Steps

1. **Create VPC Network for Secure Development Environment**:

   Google Cloud networking provides the foundation for secure, isolated development environments. Creating a dedicated VPC network ensures that database development workloads are properly segmented while enabling controlled access to external resources. This network-level isolation is essential for enterprise security policies and compliance requirements.

   ```bash
   # Create VPC network for workstations
   gcloud compute networks create db-dev-network \
       --subnet-mode=regional \
       --description="Network for database development workstations"
   
   # Create subnet for workstations
   gcloud compute networks subnets create db-dev-subnet \
       --network=db-dev-network \
       --range=10.0.0.0/24 \
       --region=${REGION}
   
   # Create firewall rule for internal communication
   gcloud compute firewall-rules create db-dev-allow-internal \
       --network=db-dev-network \
       --allow=tcp,udp,icmp \
       --source-ranges=10.0.0.0/24
   
   echo "✅ VPC network and subnet created for secure development"
   ```

   The network infrastructure is now established with proper segmentation and firewall rules. This foundation enables secure communication between workstations and database instances while maintaining isolation from other environments, following Google Cloud security best practices for development workloads.

2. **Create Cloud Workstations Cluster**:

   Cloud Workstations clusters provide the compute infrastructure for managed development environments. The cluster configuration defines the underlying Compute Engine resources, networking, and security policies that will host individual developer workstations. This managed approach eliminates the overhead of maintaining individual development machines while ensuring consistent security and compliance.

   ```bash
   # Create workstations cluster
   gcloud workstations clusters create ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --network=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/global/networks/db-dev-network \
       --subnetwork=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/regions/${REGION}/subnetworks/db-dev-subnet \
       --labels=environment=development,team=database
   
   # Wait for cluster to be ready
   echo "Waiting for cluster to be ready..."
   while [[ $(gcloud workstations clusters describe ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} --format="value(state)") != "ACTIVE" ]]; do
       echo "Cluster still creating..."
       sleep 30
   done
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Workstations cluster created: ${CLUSTER_NAME}"
   ```

   The workstations cluster is now operational and ready to host development environments. This managed infrastructure provides scalable compute resources with built-in security controls, automated patching, and integration with Google Cloud's identity and access management systems.

3. **Create Custom Workstation Configuration for Database Development**:

   Workstation configurations define the development environment specifications including container images, compute resources, and pre-installed tools. Creating a specialized configuration for database development ensures that all team members have consistent access to PostgreSQL tools, development libraries, and the AlloyDB Omni container runtime needed for efficient database application development.

   ```bash
   # Create workstation configuration with database development tools
   cat > workstation-config.yaml << EOF
   displayName: "Database Development Environment"
   machineType: "e2-standard-4"
   bootDiskSizeGb: 100
   container:
     image: "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest"
     env:
       DEBIAN_FRONTEND: noninteractive
   runAsUser: 1000
   persistentDirectories:
     - mountPath: "/home/user"
       gcePersistentDisk:
         sizeGb: 200
         diskType: "pd-standard"
   labels:
     environment: "development"
     purpose: "database-development"
   EOF
   
   # Create the configuration
   gcloud workstations configs create ${CONFIG_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --cluster=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --from-file=workstation-config.yaml
   
   echo "✅ Workstation configuration created: ${CONFIG_NAME}"
   ```

   The database development configuration is now available for creating workstations. This standardized environment ensures all developers have consistent access to development tools, proper resource allocation, and persistent storage for their work, while maintaining security through the managed container environment.

4. **Set Up Cloud Source Repository for Database Projects**:

   Cloud Source Repositories provides secure, private Git repositories that integrate seamlessly with Google Cloud's development and deployment tools. Creating a dedicated repository for database development projects enables version control, collaboration, and automated build triggers while maintaining code security within your Google Cloud organization.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Source Repository
   gcloud source repos create ${REPO_NAME} \
       --description="Repository for database development projects"
   
   # Get repository clone URL
   REPO_URL=$(gcloud source repos describe ${REPO_NAME} \
       --format="value(url)")
   
   # Create initial repository structure
   mkdir -p temp-repo
   cd temp-repo
   
   git init
   git config user.email "developer@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   git config user.name "Database Development Team"
   
   # Create directory structure for database projects
   mkdir -p {schemas,migrations,functions,tests,docker}
   
   # Create README with project setup instructions
   cat > README.md << EOF
   # Database Development Project
   
   This repository contains database schemas, migrations, functions, and tests
   for our database development workflow using AlloyDB Omni.
   
   ## Structure
   - \`schemas/\` - Database schema definitions
   - \`migrations/\` - Database migration scripts
   - \`functions/\` - Stored procedures and functions
   - \`tests/\` - Database tests and validation scripts
   - \`docker/\` - AlloyDB Omni container configurations
   EOF
   
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial repository setup for database development"
   
   # Add remote and push
   git remote add origin ${REPO_URL}
   git push origin main
   
   cd ..
   rm -rf temp-repo
   
   echo "✅ Source repository created: ${REPO_NAME}"
   echo "Repository URL: ${REPO_URL}"
   ```

   The source repository is now configured with a proper structure for database development projects. This centralized code management enables team collaboration, version tracking, and serves as the foundation for automated build and deployment processes integrated with the development workflow.

5. **Create AlloyDB Omni Container Configuration**:

   AlloyDB Omni provides PostgreSQL-compatible database capabilities with enhanced performance for both transactional and analytical workloads. Creating a standardized container configuration ensures consistent database environments across development, testing, and staging while leveraging AlloyDB's advanced features like the integrated columnar engine and AI capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create Docker configuration for AlloyDB Omni
   mkdir -p alloydb-config
   cd alloydb-config
   
   # Create docker-compose file for AlloyDB Omni
   cat > docker-compose.yml << EOF
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     alloydb-omni:
       image: google/alloydbomni:16.8.0
       container_name: alloydb-dev
       environment:

         - POSTGRES_USER=dev_user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev_password_123
         - ALLOYDB_COLUMNAR_ENGINE=on
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
       volumes:
         - alloydb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
         - ./init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
       networks:
         - db-network
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U dev_user -d development_db"]
         interval: 30s
         timeout: 10s
         retries: 3
   
   volumes:
     alloydb_data:
   
   networks:
     db-network:
       driver: bridge
   EOF
   
   # Create initialization scripts
   mkdir -p init-scripts
   cat > init-scripts/01-create-extensions.sql << EOF
   -- Enable required extensions for AlloyDB development
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS google_columnar_engine;
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
   
   -- Create development schema
   CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS app_development;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA app_development TO dev_user;
   EOF
   
   # Create development setup script
   cat > setup-dev-db.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Setting up AlloyDB Omni development environment..."
   
   # Start AlloyDB Omni container
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Wait for database to be ready
   echo "Waiting for database to be ready..."
   until docker exec alloydb-dev pg_isready -U dev_user -d development_db; do
     echo "Database is starting up..."
     sleep 2
   done
   
   echo "✅ AlloyDB Omni development environment is ready"
   echo "Connection string: postgresql://dev_user:dev_password_123@localhost:5432/development_db"
   EOF
   
   chmod +x setup-dev-db.sh
   
   cd ..
   
   echo "✅ AlloyDB Omni container configuration created"
   ```

   The AlloyDB Omni development environment is now configured with proper initialization scripts and Docker Compose setup. This standardized database environment provides enhanced PostgreSQL capabilities including columnar analytics, vector search, and performance optimizations that developers can use consistently across their local development workflow.

6. **Create Development Workstation and Install Database Tools**:

   Individual workstations provide developers with personalized, secure development environments that include all necessary database development tools. Creating a workstation from the standardized configuration ensures consistent tool availability while allowing for individual customization and workflow preferences within the managed environment.

   ```bash
   # Create a development workstation
   export WORKSTATION_NAME="db-dev-workstation-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   
   gcloud workstations create ${WORKSTATION_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --cluster=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --config=${CONFIG_NAME} \
       --labels=developer=primary,project=database-development
   
   # Wait for workstation to be ready
   echo "Waiting for workstation to be ready..."
   while [[ $(gcloud workstations describe ${WORKSTATION_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --cluster=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --config=${CONFIG_NAME} \
       --format="value(state)") != "ACTIVE" ]]; do
       echo "Workstation still creating..."
       sleep 30
   done
   
   echo "✅ Development workstation created: ${WORKSTATION_NAME}"
   echo "Access workstation via: gcloud workstations start ${WORKSTATION_NAME} --region=${REGION} --cluster=${CLUSTER_NAME} --config=${CONFIG_NAME}"
   ```

   The development workstation is now provisioned and ready for database development work. Developers can access this managed environment through their browser or local IDE integrations, providing a consistent development platform with built-in security, monitoring, and collaboration features while maintaining individual productivity preferences.

7. **Configure Cloud Build for Automated Database Testing**:

   Cloud Build provides serverless CI/CD capabilities that can automatically test database changes, run migrations, and validate schema modifications. Setting up automated build triggers ensures that database changes are properly tested before deployment while maintaining development velocity through continuous integration practices.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Build configuration for database testing
   cat > cloudbuild.yaml << EOF
   steps:
     # Start AlloyDB Omni for testing
     - name: 'docker/compose:1.29.2'
       args: ['-f', 'alloydb-config/docker-compose.yml', 'up', '-d']
       env:
         - 'COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=test-db'
   
     # Wait for database to be ready
     - name: 'postgres:15'
       entrypoint: 'bash'
       args:
         - '-c'
         - |
           apt-get update && apt-get install -y postgresql-client
           until pg_isready -h alloydb-dev -p 5432 -U dev_user; do
             echo "Waiting for database..."
             sleep 5
           done
           echo "Database is ready"
   
     # Run database migrations
     - name: 'postgres:15'
       entrypoint: 'bash'
       args:
         - '-c'
         - |
           apt-get update && apt-get install -y postgresql-client
           for file in migrations/*.sql; do
             if [ -f "\$file" ]; then
               echo "Running migration: \$file"
               PGPASSWORD=dev_password_123 psql -h alloydb-dev -U dev_user -d development_db -f "\$file"
             fi
           done
   
     # Run database tests
     - name: 'postgres:15'
       entrypoint: 'bash'
       args:
         - '-c'
         - |
           apt-get update && apt-get install -y postgresql-client
           for file in tests/*.sql; do
             if [ -f "\$file" ]; then
               echo "Running test: \$file"
               PGPASSWORD=dev_password_123 psql -h alloydb-dev -U dev_user -d development_db -f "\$file"
             fi
           done
   
     # Cleanup
     - name: 'docker/compose:1.29.2'
       args: ['-f', 'alloydb-config/docker-compose.yml', 'down', '-v']
       env:
         - 'COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=test-db'
   
   options:
     logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
     machineType: 'E2_HIGHCPU_8'
   timeout: 1800s
   EOF
   
   # Create build trigger for main branch
   gcloud builds triggers create cloud-source-repositories \
       --repo=${REPO_NAME} \
       --branch-pattern="^main$" \
       --build-config=cloudbuild.yaml \
       --description="Automated database testing on main branch"
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Build trigger created for automated database testing"
   ```

   The automated testing pipeline is now configured to run database migrations and tests whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. This continuous integration approach ensures database schema changes are validated automatically while providing fast feedback to developers about potential issues before they reach production environments.

8. **Create Database Development Workflow Templates**:

   Standardized workflow templates help development teams follow consistent practices for database schema changes, migrations, and testing. Creating these templates within the source repository ensures that all team members can easily initiate new features, bug fixes, or schema modifications using proven patterns and best practices.

   ```bash
   # Create workflow templates in the repository
   mkdir -p temp-repo-templates
   cd temp-repo-templates
   git clone ${REPO_URL} .
   
   # Create migration template
   mkdir -p templates/migrations
   cat > templates/migrations/migration_template.sql << EOF
   -- Migration: [DESCRIPTION]
   -- Author: [AUTHOR]
   -- Date: [DATE]
   -- Jira/Issue: [ISSUE_NUMBER]
   
   BEGIN;
   
   -- Add your migration script here
   -- Example:
   -- CREATE TABLE app_development.new_table (
   --     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   --     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   --     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   -- );
   
   -- Verify migration success
   -- SELECT * FROM app_development.new_table LIMIT 1;
   
   COMMIT;
   EOF
   
   # Create test template
   mkdir -p templates/tests
   cat > templates/tests/test_template.sql << EOF
   -- Test: [TEST_DESCRIPTION]
   -- Author: [AUTHOR]
   -- Date: [DATE]
   
   -- Test setup
   BEGIN;
   
   -- Create test data
   -- INSERT INTO app_development.test_table (column1, column2)
   -- VALUES ('test_value1', 'test_value2');
   
   -- Run assertions
   -- SELECT CASE
   --     WHEN COUNT(*) = 1 THEN 'PASS: Test assertion successful'
   --     ELSE 'FAIL: Test assertion failed'
   -- END as test_result
   -- FROM app_development.test_table
   -- WHERE column1 = 'test_value1';
   
   -- Cleanup test data
   ROLLBACK;
   EOF
   
   # Create development workflow guide
   cat > DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md << EOF
   # Database Development Workflow
   
   ## Getting Started
   1. Access your Cloud Workstation through the Google Cloud Console
   2. Clone this repository in your workstation
   3. Start AlloyDB Omni using: \`cd alloydb-config && ./setup-dev-db.sh\`

## Discussion

This recipe demonstrates how Google Cloud's managed development services can streamline database development workflows while maintaining security and consistency. The combination of Cloud Workstations and AlloyDB Omni provides developers with powerful, standardized environments that eliminate the traditional challenges of local development setup and environment drift.

Cloud Workstations offer several key advantages for database development teams. The managed service provides consistent, secure development environments accessible from any device while maintaining enterprise security controls through Google Cloud's identity and access management. Developers benefit from persistent storage, standardized tooling, and automatic security updates without the overhead of managing individual development machines. The browser-based access model enables remote development capabilities while the integration with local IDEs maintains developer productivity preferences.

AlloyDB Omni brings enterprise-grade PostgreSQL capabilities to development environments with performance enhancements that aren't available in standard PostgreSQL deployments. The integrated columnar engine enables efficient analytical queries during development and testing, while the vector database capabilities support modern AI-enhanced applications. The container-based deployment model ensures consistency between development, testing, and production environments while providing the flexibility to run anywhere from developer laptops to cloud infrastructure.

The automated CI/CD integration through Cloud Build ensures that database changes follow proper testing protocols before reaching production. This approach reduces the risk of schema-related issues while maintaining development velocity through automated validation. The combination of source control, automated testing, and standardized development environments creates a robust foundation for database application development that scales with team growth and complexity requirements.

> **Tip**: Consider implementing database schema versioning and migration rollback procedures as part of your development workflow. AlloyDB Omni's backup and restore capabilities can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline for additional safety during schema changes.
