> **Note**: This recipe creates premium Confidential Computing resources that may incur higher costs than standard instances. Monitor usage and clean up resources promptly after testing.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="privacy-analytics-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export CLUSTER_NAME="confidential-cluster-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export KEYRING_NAME="analytics-keyring-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export KEY_NAME="analytics-key-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export DATASET_NAME="sensitive_analytics_${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BUCKET_NAME="privacy-analytics-${PROJECT_ID}-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs for confidential computing and analytics
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ APIs enabled for confidential computing and analytics"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud KMS Key Ring and Encryption Keys**:

   Cloud KMS provides centralized key management with envelope encryption for protecting sensitive data throughout the analytics pipeline. Creating dedicated encryption keys ensures that all data processing maintains cryptographic boundaries and supports regulatory compliance requirements.

   ```bash
   # Create KMS key ring for analytics encryption
   gcloud kms keyrings create ${KEYRING_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION}
   
   # Create symmetric encryption key for data protection
   gcloud kms keys create ${KEY_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --keyring=${KEYRING_NAME} \
       --purpose=encryption
   
   # Store key resource name for later use
   export KEY_RESOURCE_NAME="projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${REGION}/keyRings/${KEYRING_NAME}/cryptoKeys/${KEY_NAME}"
   
   echo "✅ KMS key ring and encryption key created"
   echo "Key resource: ${KEY_RESOURCE_NAME}"
   ```

   The encryption key is now available for protecting data across all analytics services. This key will encrypt data at rest in BigQuery and provide additional security for Confidential GKE workloads, ensuring end-to-end encryption throughout the analytics pipeline.

2. **Create Confidential GKE Cluster with Hardware Encryption**:

   Confidential GKE nodes utilize AMD SEV or Intel TDX technologies to provide hardware-based memory encryption, protecting data during processing. This ensures that sensitive data remains encrypted even when loaded into memory for analysis, meeting the highest security standards for regulated industries.

   ```bash
   # Create Confidential GKE cluster with AMD SEV encryption
   gcloud container clusters create ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --zone=${ZONE} \
       --machine-type=n2d-standard-4 \
       --num-nodes=2 \
       --confidential-node-type=sev \
       --disk-encryption-key=${KEY_RESOURCE_NAME} \
       --enable-ip-alias \
       --enable-autorepair \
       --enable-autoupgrade \
       --logging=SYSTEM,WORKLOAD \
       --monitoring=SYSTEM \
       --cluster-version=latest
   
   # Get cluster credentials for kubectl access
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --zone=${ZONE}
   
   # Verify confidential computing is enabled
   kubectl get nodes -o wide
   
   echo "✅ Confidential GKE cluster created with hardware encryption"
   ```

   The cluster now provides hardware-level protection for workloads with encrypted memory and secure enclaves. All data processed within the cluster benefits from AMD SEV encryption, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected during computation and analysis operations.

3. **Create BigQuery Dataset with Customer-Managed Encryption**:

   BigQuery with CMEK provides encrypted data warehousing where analytical queries execute against encrypted data without exposing plaintext. The customer-managed encryption keys ensure that organizations maintain full control over their data encryption while leveraging BigQuery's serverless analytics capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset with CMEK encryption
   bq mk --dataset \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --default_kms_key=${KEY_RESOURCE_NAME} \
       --description="Privacy-preserving analytics dataset with CMEK" \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   # Create sample sensitive data table with proper schema
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.patient_analytics \
       patient_id:STRING,age:INTEGER,diagnosis:STRING,treatment_cost:FLOAT,region:STRING,admission_date:DATE
   
   # Insert sample encrypted data with realistic healthcare patterns
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
       --destination_table=${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.patient_analytics \
       --replace \
       "SELECT 
           CONCAT('PATIENT_', LPAD(CAST(ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS STRING), 6, '0')) as patient_id,
           CAST(RAND() * 80 + 20 AS INT64) as age,
           CASE CAST(RAND() * 5 AS INT64)
               WHEN 0 THEN 'Diabetes'
               WHEN 1 THEN 'Hypertension'
               WHEN 2 THEN 'Heart Disease'
               WHEN 3 THEN 'Cancer'
               ELSE 'Respiratory Disease'
           END as diagnosis,
           ROUND(RAND() * 50000 + 5000, 2) as treatment_cost,
           CASE CAST(RAND() * 4 AS INT64)
               WHEN 0 THEN 'North'
               WHEN 1 THEN 'South'
               WHEN 2 THEN 'East'
               ELSE 'West'
           END as region,
           DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL CAST(RAND() * 365 AS INT64) DAY) as admission_date
       FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_ARRAY(1, 10000)) as num"
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery dataset created with CMEK encryption and sample data"
   ```

   The dataset now stores sensitive healthcare data with customer-managed encryption, ensuring compliance with healthcare privacy regulations. All analytical operations will execute against encrypted data, maintaining privacy while enabling powerful insights through BigQuery's SQL analytics engine.

4. **Deploy Privacy-Preserving Data Processing Application**:

   Deploy a containerized application on Confidential GKE that processes sensitive data within encrypted memory. This application demonstrates how to perform data transformations and analytics while maintaining hardware-level encryption throughout the processing pipeline.

   ```bash
   # Create privacy-preserving analytics application manifest
   cat > analytics-app.yaml << 'EOF'

   The machine learning training job now processes sensitive healthcare data with full encryption support. Vertex AI maintains data privacy throughout the training pipeline while producing models that can provide valuable insights for healthcare analytics and decision-making.

6. **Set Up Privacy-Preserving Query Analytics**:

   Configure BigQuery for privacy-preserving analytics that supports differential privacy and secure aggregations. This enables organizations to gain insights from sensitive data while maintaining individual privacy through mathematical privacy guarantees.

   ```bash
   # Create privacy-preserving analytics views with k-anonymity
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false << EOF
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.privacy_analytics_summary\` AS
   SELECT
     diagnosis,
     region,
     -- Use aggregation functions that preserve privacy
     COUNT(*) as patient_count,
     APPROX_QUANTILES(age, 4)[OFFSET(2)] as median_age,
     ROUND(STDDEV(treatment_cost), 2) as cost_variance,
     -- Only show results with sufficient sample size for privacy (k=10)
     CASE 
       WHEN COUNT(*) >= 10 THEN ROUND(AVG(treatment_cost), 2)
       ELSE NULL 
     END as avg_treatment_cost,
     -- Add time-based privacy protection

       jq '.defaultEncryptionConfiguration'
   
   # Test privacy-preserving analytics queries with parameters
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
       "SELECT * FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.privacy_preserved_analysis\`(10, 2.0, 1.0) LIMIT 5"
   
   # Validate compliance report
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
       "SELECT * FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.compliance_report\`"
   
   # Check data encryption at rest
   gcloud kms keys list --location=${REGION} \
       --keyring=${KEYRING_NAME} \
       --format="table(name,purpose,createTime)"
   ```

   Expected output: CMEK configuration details, successful privacy-preserving query results, and compliance report data.

3. **Verify Vertex AI Training Security**:

   ```bash
   # Check training job status and encryption
   gcloud ai custom-jobs list --region=${REGION} \
       --format="table(displayName,state,createTime)"
   
   # Verify model artifacts are encrypted
   gsutil ls -L gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/model/ | \
       grep -i "kms\|encryption"
   
   # Check training logs for privacy compliance
   gcloud ai custom-jobs describe \
       $(gcloud ai custom-jobs list --region=${REGION} --format="value(name)" --limit=1) \
       --region=${REGION} | grep -i "privacy\|encrypt"
   ```

   Expected output: Completed training job with encrypted model artifacts and privacy-preserving training verification.

## Cleanup

1. **Remove Vertex AI resources and training artifacts**:

   ```bash
   # Cancel any running training jobs
   gcloud ai custom-jobs cancel \
       $(gcloud ai custom-jobs list --region=${REGION} \
       --filter="state:JOB_STATE_RUNNING" --format="value(name)") \
       --region=${REGION} 2>/dev/null || true
   
   # Delete Cloud Storage bucket and contents
   gsutil -m rm -r gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ ML training artifacts cleaned up"
   ```

2. **Delete BigQuery encrypted dataset**:

   ```bash
   # Remove BigQuery dataset and all tables/views
   bq rm -r -f ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery encrypted dataset deleted"
   ```

3. **Remove Confidential GKE cluster**:

   ```bash
   # Delete Kubernetes applications first
   kubectl delete deployment privacy-analytics-app --ignore-not-found=true
   kubectl delete service privacy-analytics-service --ignore-not-found=true
   
   # Delete the confidential cluster
   gcloud container clusters delete ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --zone=${ZONE} \
       --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Confidential GKE cluster deleted"
   ```

4. **Remove Cloud KMS encryption keys**:

   ```bash
   # Schedule key for destruction (cannot be immediate for security)
   gcloud kms keys versions destroy 1 \
       --key=${KEY_NAME} \
       --keyring=${KEYRING_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Encryption keys scheduled for destruction"
   echo "Note: KMS keys require a 24-hour waiting period before final deletion"
   echo "Cost monitoring: Resources have been removed to stop ongoing charges"
   ```

## Discussion

This solution demonstrates privacy-preserving analytics using Google Cloud's Confidential Computing technologies, addressing critical requirements for regulated industries that must analyze sensitive data while maintaining strict privacy controls. The architecture combines multiple layers of encryption and secure computing to ensure data protection throughout the entire analytics pipeline.

**Confidential GKE** provides hardware-based memory encryption using AMD SEV or Intel TDX technologies, ensuring that sensitive data remains encrypted even when loaded into memory for processing. This addresses the traditional vulnerability where data must be decrypted during computation, enabling secure analytics on sensitive information like healthcare records or financial data. The hardware-level protection ensures that even privileged system administrators cannot access plaintext data during processing operations, meeting the requirements of zero-trust security models.

**BigQuery with Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)** extends privacy protection to the data warehousing layer, enabling encrypted analytics at scale. The integration with Cloud KMS ensures that organizations maintain full control over their encryption keys while leveraging BigQuery's serverless analytics capabilities. This approach supports complex analytical queries against encrypted datasets without exposing sensitive information, making it ideal for compliance-sensitive environments that require both privacy and analytical power. The solution implements k-anonymity principles to ensure individual privacy protection.

**Privacy-preserving analytics techniques** such as differential privacy and k-anonymity are implemented within this framework to provide mathematical privacy guarantees. The solution supports controlled data aggregations that prevent individual record identification while still enabling valuable insights for business intelligence and machine learning applications. Organizations can perform comprehensive data analysis while meeting regulatory requirements like HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS through technical privacy controls rather than just procedural safeguards.

The integration with **Vertex AI** enables privacy-preserving machine learning workflows where model training occurs on encrypted data within secure computing environments. This supports advanced analytics use cases such as predictive modeling for healthcare outcomes or fraud detection for financial services, where data privacy is paramount but analytical insights are critical for business operations. The automated encryption of training artifacts ensures end-to-end privacy protection throughout the ML lifecycle.

> **Tip**: Monitor your confidential computing workloads using Cloud Monitoring to track performance metrics and ensure optimal resource utilization, as confidential computing may have 5-10% performance impacts compared to standard instances, but provides unmatched security guarantees.
