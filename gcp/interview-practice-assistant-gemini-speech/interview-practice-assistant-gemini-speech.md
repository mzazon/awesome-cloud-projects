# Interview Practice Assistant using Gemini and Speech-to-Text

## Problem

Job seekers struggle with interview preparation, lacking access to realistic practice sessions and personalized feedback on their responses. Traditional mock interviews require human interviewers, making them expensive and scheduling-dependent, while most candidates receive generic advice that doesn't address their specific weaknesses or communication patterns.

## Solution

Build an intelligent interview practice platform using Google Cloud's AI services that conducts realistic mock interviews, transcribes spoken responses using Speech-to-Text, and provides detailed analysis and improvement recommendations through Vertex AI's Gemini model. This serverless solution scales automatically and provides 24/7 availability for interview practice.

## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud account with billing enabled and appropriate permissions for Vertex AI, Speech-to-Text, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Storage
2. Google Cloud CLI (gcloud) installed and configured
3. Basic understanding of serverless functions and AI APIs
4. Audio recording capability for testing (microphone or audio files)
5. Estimated cost: $8-15 for initial testing and development

> **Note**: This solution uses pay-per-use pricing for AI APIs and serverless functions, making it cost-effective for individual practice sessions.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="interview-practice-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export BUCKET_NAME="interview-audio-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export FUNCTION_PREFIX="interview-assistant"

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set functions/region ${REGION}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable speech.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ Resources will use suffix: ${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket for Audio Files**:

   Cloud Storage provides secure, scalable object storage for interview audio recordings with built-in versioning and lifecycle management. The bucket will store both uploaded audio files and processed transcription results, enabling the serverless functions to access audio data reliably across processing stages while maintaining cost efficiency through automated cleanup policies.

   ```bash
   # Create bucket for audio storage
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Set appropriate lifecycle policy for cost optimization
   cat > lifecycle.json << EOF
   {
     "rule": [
       {
         "condition": {"age": 30},
         "action": {"type": "Delete"}
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF
   
   gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Storage bucket created: gs://${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket is now configured with automatic cleanup after 30 days to manage costs while providing reliable storage for the interview practice workflow with Google Cloud's 99.95% availability SLA.

2. **Create Speech-to-Text Processing Function**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless execution for speech processing with automatic scaling based on demand. This function receives audio files from Cloud Storage and uses the Speech-to-Text API to generate accurate transcriptions with confidence scores and timing information, supporting multiple audio formats and optimized for conversation analysis.

   ```bash
   # Create directory for speech function
   mkdir -p speech-function
   cd speech-function
   
   # Create requirements.txt for dependencies
   cat > requirements.txt << EOF
   google-cloud-speech==2.23.0

       try:
           request_json = request.get_json()
           bucket_name = request_json['bucket']
           file_name = request_json['file']
           
           # Initialize clients
           speech_client = speech.SpeechClient()
           storage_client = storage.Client()
           
           # Get audio file from Cloud Storage
           bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
           blob = bucket.blob(file_name)
           audio_content = blob.download_as_bytes()
           
           # Configure speech recognition with optimized settings
           audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=audio_content)
           config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
               encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.WEBM_OPUS,
               sample_rate_hertz=48000,
               language_code="en-US",
               enable_automatic_punctuation=True,
               enable_spoken_punctuation=True,
               enable_word_confidence=True,
               enable_word_time_offsets=True,
               model="latest_long",
               use_enhanced=True
           )
           
           # Perform transcription
           response = speech_client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio)
           
           # Process results with detailed confidence tracking
           transcription = ""
           confidence_scores = []
           word_details = []
           
           for result in response.results:
               transcription += result.alternatives[0].transcript + " "
               confidence_scores.append(result.alternatives[0].confidence)
               
               # Extract word-level details for analysis
               for word in result.alternatives[0].words:
                   word_details.append({
                       'word': word.word,

                       'start_time': word.start_time.total_seconds(),
                       'end_time': word.end_time.total_seconds()
                   })
           
           return {
               'transcription': transcription.strip(),
               'confidence': sum(confidence_scores) / len(confidence_scores) if confidence_scores else 0,
               'word_details': word_details,
               'status': 'success'
           }
           
       except Exception as e:
           return {'error': str(e), 'status': 'error'}
   EOF
   
   # Deploy the speech function
   gcloud functions deploy ${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-speech \
       --runtime python311 \
       --trigger-http \
       --allow-unauthenticated \
       --source . \
       --entry-point transcribe_audio \
       --memory 512MB \
       --timeout 120s
   
   cd ..
   echo "✅ Speech-to-Text function deployed"
   ```

   The Speech-to-Text function is now deployed with the latest enhanced model for improved accuracy and word-level timing analysis, providing detailed transcription data for comprehensive interview feedback.

   The orchestration function provides a single endpoint for the complete interview analysis workflow, with robust error handling, retry logic, and extended timeout for comprehensive processing.

5. **Configure IAM Permissions**:

   Proper Identity and Access Management ensures secure communication between services while following Google Cloud's principle of least privilege. These granular permissions enable the functions to access only the required Google Cloud services for their specific roles, maintaining security boundaries while enabling seamless service-to-service communication.

   ```bash
   # Get the project number for service account identification
   PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --format="value(projectNumber)")
   
   # Create custom service account for functions
   gcloud iam service-accounts create interview-assistant \
       --display-name="Interview Assistant Service Account" \
       --description="Service account for interview practice functions"
   
   SERVICE_ACCOUNT="interview-assistant@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   
   # Grant necessary permissions with least privilege principle
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
       --role="roles/speech.client"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
       --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
       --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"
   
   # Update functions to use the service account
   gcloud functions deploy ${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-speech \
       --service-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} \

       else:
           print("\n⚠️  Some components need attention before full deployment")
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   EOF
   
   # Make test script executable
   chmod +x test_interview.py
   
   # Store function URLs for easy access
   echo "✅ Test framework created"
   echo ""
   echo "Function URLs:"
   echo "Speech Function: https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-speech"
   echo "Analysis Function: https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-analysis"
   echo "Orchestration Function: https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-orchestrate"

   gcloud functions list --filter="name:${FUNCTION_PREFIX}"
   
   # Test function connectivity and status
   ORCHESTRATE_URL="https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-orchestrate"
   
   echo "Function deployment verification:"
   echo "Orchestration URL: ${ORCHESTRATE_URL}"
   echo "Expected: Three functions with ACTIVE status"
   ```

   Expected output: Three functions listed with ACTIVE status and proper URLs displayed.

2. **Test Speech-to-Text Function**:

   ```bash
   # Test the speech function directly (requires actual audio file)
   SPEECH_URL="https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-speech"
   
   curl -X POST ${SPEECH_URL} \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"bucket":"'${BUCKET_NAME}'","file":"test_audio.wav"}' \
       || echo "Upload actual audio file to test transcription"
   ```

   Expected behavior: Function responds with JSON containing transcription status (success with audio file, error without).

3. **Test Gemini Analysis Function**:

   ```bash
   # Test analysis function with sample text
   ANALYSIS_URL="https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-analysis"
   
   curl -X POST ${ANALYSIS_URL} \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "transcription": "I am a software engineer with five years of experience in full-stack development. I have worked on various projects including web applications and mobile apps.",
         "question": "Tell me about yourself",
         "confidence": 0.95
       }'
   ```

   Expected output: Detailed JSON response with Gemini analysis including content evaluation and improvement recommendations.

4. **Run Comprehensive Test Suite**:

   ```bash
   # Execute the test framework
   python test_interview.py
   ```

   Expected output: Test results showing analysis function success and orchestration readiness confirmation.

5. **Verify Cloud Storage Access**:

   ```bash
   # Verify bucket accessibility and lifecycle policy
   gsutil ls -L gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   gsutil lifecycle get gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   ```

   Expected output: Bucket details with lifecycle policy showing 30-day deletion rule.

## Cleanup

1. **Delete Cloud Functions**:

   ```bash
   # Remove all deployed functions
   gcloud functions delete ${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-speech \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --quiet
   
   gcloud functions delete ${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-analysis \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --quiet
   
   gcloud functions delete ${FUNCTION_PREFIX}-orchestrate \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Functions deleted"
   ```

2. **Remove Storage Resources**:

   ```bash
   # Delete bucket and all contents
   gsutil -m rm -r gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Storage bucket deleted"
   ```

3. **Clean up IAM and Local Files**:

   ```bash
   # Remove service account
   gcloud iam service-accounts delete ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} --quiet
   
   # Remove local files and directories
   rm -rf speech-function analysis-function orchestration-function
   rm -f lifecycle.json interview_questions.json test_interview.py
   
   # Delete project (if created specifically for this recipe)
   gcloud projects delete ${PROJECT_ID} --quiet
   
   echo "✅ All resources cleaned up"
   echo "Note: Project deletion may take several minutes to complete"
   ```

## Discussion

This interview practice assistant demonstrates the sophisticated capabilities of Google Cloud's AI platform for creating user-facing applications that provide real value to job seekers and professionals. The architecture leverages **Vertex AI's Gemini 1.5 Pro model** for advanced natural language understanding, providing nuanced feedback that evaluates not just content accuracy but communication effectiveness, professional presentation skills, and interview best practices alignment.

The **Speech-to-Text API integration** with enhanced models showcases Google Cloud's commitment to multimodal AI experiences. By configuring the service with word-level confidence scores, timing information, and the latest enhanced models, the solution provides detailed feedback about speech patterns, pacing, and clarity—critical factors in interview success that traditional text-based practice tools cannot address. The confidence scoring enables the system to identify areas where candidates may need to speak more clearly or confidently.

The **serverless architecture using Cloud Functions** ensures cost-effectiveness and automatic scalability. Each function serves a specific purpose (transcription, analysis, orchestration), following microservices principles while maintaining loose coupling. This design allows for independent scaling based on demand, makes the system resilient to failures in individual components, and enables easy maintenance and updates to specific functionality without affecting the entire system.

**Security considerations** are fundamental to this implementation. The custom service account follows Google Cloud's principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum permissions required for each service to function. The IAM configuration ensures that sensitive interview data remains protected while enabling seamless service-to-service communication. For production deployments, additional security measures such as VPC Service Controls, Cloud KMS encryption for data at rest, and Cloud Armor for DDoS protection should be considered.

The solution's **cost optimization** through Cloud Storage lifecycle policies and pay-per-use pricing models makes it accessible for individual users while remaining economically viable for larger organizations. The 30-day deletion policy balances data retention needs with storage costs, and the serverless functions only incur charges during actual usage, making this solution particularly cost-effective for sporadic interview practice sessions.

> **Tip**: Consider implementing caching strategies for frequently used interview questions and common analysis patterns to reduce API calls and improve response times during peak usage periods.
