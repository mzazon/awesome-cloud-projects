# Dynamic Pricing Optimization using BigQuery and Vertex AI

## Problem

Retail and e-commerce businesses struggle with static pricing strategies that fail to respond to real-time market conditions, competitor pricing changes, and fluctuating demand patterns. Traditional pricing approaches leave millions in revenue on the table, with businesses missing opportunities to optimize prices based on customer behavior, inventory levels, and competitive dynamics. Manual price adjustments are too slow and error-prone to capture the rapid market changes that occur multiple times per day in modern digital commerce.

## Solution

Build an intelligent pricing system that leverages BigQuery's machine learning capabilities and Vertex AI's advanced ML models to analyze market data, competitor pricing, and demand patterns in real-time. The solution uses Cloud Functions for serverless processing, Cloud Scheduler for automated price updates, and combines BigQuery ML for rapid prototyping with Vertex AI for production-grade machine learning models that automatically optimize product prices based on multiple data sources and business objectives.

echo "✅ Cloud Storage bucket created: gs://${BUCKET_NAME}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create BigQuery Dataset and Sample Data**:

   BigQuery serves as the central data warehouse for our pricing optimization system, providing serverless analytics capabilities that can process terabytes of transactional and market data. Creating a properly structured dataset with partitioning and clustering enables efficient querying of historical sales data, competitor pricing information, and market conditions that drive pricing decisions.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset
   bq mk --dataset \
       --description "Dataset for dynamic pricing optimization" \
       --location=${REGION} \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   # Create sales history table with partitioning for performance
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.sales_history \
       product_id:STRING,sale_date:DATE,price:FLOAT,quantity:INTEGER,revenue:FLOAT,competitor_price:FLOAT,inventory_level:INTEGER,season:STRING,promotion:BOOLEAN
   
   # Create competitor pricing table
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.competitor_pricing \
       product_id:STRING,competitor:STRING,price:FLOAT,timestamp:TIMESTAMP,availability:BOOLEAN
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery dataset and tables created successfully"
   ```

   The dataset structure supports both historical analysis and real-time pricing decisions, with proper partitioning by date to optimize query performance and reduce costs. This foundation enables the machine learning models to analyze patterns across multiple dimensions including seasonality, competition, and inventory dynamics.

2. **Load Sample Training Data**:

   Training data forms the foundation of any successful machine learning model. For pricing optimization, we need diverse historical data that captures the relationship between pricing decisions and business outcomes across different market conditions, competitor scenarios, and customer segments.

   ```bash
   # Create sample data file for training
   cat > sample_sales_data.csv << 'EOF'
   product_id,sale_date,price,quantity,revenue,competitor_price,inventory_level,season,promotion
   PROD001,2024-01-15,29.99,150,4498.50,31.99,1200,winter,false
   PROD001,2024-02-15,27.99,180,5038.20,30.99,800,winter,true
   PROD001,2024-03-15,32.99,120,3958.80,34.99,1500,spring,false
   PROD002,2024-01-15,15.99,200,3198.00,16.99,500,winter,false
   PROD002,2024-02-15,14.99,250,3747.50,15.99,300,winter,true
   PROD002,2024-03-15,17.99,180,3238.20,18.99,600,spring,false
   PROD003,2024-01-15,45.99,80,3679.20,47.99,200,winter,false
   PROD003,2024-02-15,42.99,100,4299.00,45.99,150,winter,true
   PROD003,2024-03-15,48.99,90,4409.10,49.99,250,spring,false
   EOF
   
   # Upload to BigQuery
   bq load \
       --source_format=CSV \
       --skip_leading_rows=1 \
       --autodetect \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.sales_history \
       sample_sales_data.csv
   
   echo "✅ Sample training data loaded into BigQuery"
   ```

   This sample dataset includes key pricing factors: base price, competitor pricing, inventory levels, seasonality, and promotional status. Real-world implementations would include thousands of products and years of historical data to capture complex pricing relationships and market dynamics.

3. **Create BigQuery ML Pricing Model**:

   BigQuery ML democratizes machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build sophisticated models without extensive programming knowledge. For pricing optimization, we'll create a linear regression model that identifies the relationships between pricing factors and revenue outcomes, providing interpretable insights for business stakeholders.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery ML model for price optimization
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false << 'EOF'
   CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `pricing_optimization.pricing_prediction_model`
   OPTIONS(
     model_type='LINEAR_REG',
     input_label_cols=['revenue'],
     data_split_method='AUTO_SPLIT',
     data_split_eval_fraction=0.2
   ) AS
   SELECT
     price,
     competitor_price,
     inventory_level,
     CASE 
       WHEN season = 'winter' THEN 1
       WHEN season = 'spring' THEN 2
       WHEN season = 'summer' THEN 3
       ELSE 4
     END as season_numeric,
     CASE WHEN promotion THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as promotion_flag,
     revenue
   FROM `pricing_optimization.sales_history`
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery ML pricing model created and trained"
   ```

   The model learns from historical pricing decisions to predict revenue outcomes based on price points, competitive positioning, inventory constraints, seasonal factors, and promotional strategies. This provides a baseline for pricing recommendations and identifies the most important factors driving revenue performance.

4. **Create Vertex AI Custom Training Job**:

   While BigQuery ML provides rapid prototyping capabilities, Vertex AI offers advanced machine learning features including hyperparameter tuning, custom algorithms, and sophisticated model management. This step creates a more sophisticated pricing model that can handle complex non-linear relationships and ensemble methods.

   ```bash
   # Create training script for advanced pricing model
   mkdir -p vertex_ai_training
   cat > vertex_ai_training/trainer.py << 'EOF'
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
   import joblib
   import argparse
   from google.cloud import bigquery
   import os
   
   def train_pricing_model():
       # Initialize BigQuery client
       client = bigquery.Client()
       
       # Query training data
       query = """
       SELECT 
           price,
           competitor_price,
           inventory_level,
           CASE 
               WHEN season = 'winter' THEN 1
               WHEN season = 'spring' THEN 2
               WHEN season = 'summer' THEN 3
               ELSE 4
           END as season_numeric,
           CASE WHEN promotion THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as promotion_flag,
           revenue
       FROM `pricing_optimization.sales_history`
       """
       
       df = client.query(query).to_dataframe()
       
       # Prepare features and target
       X = df[['price', 'competitor_price', 'inventory_level', 'season_numeric', 'promotion_flag']]
       y = df['revenue']
       
       # Split data
       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
       
       # Train Random Forest model
       model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
       model.fit(X_train, y_train)
       
       # Evaluate model
       y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
       mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
       r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
       
       print(f"Model Performance: MSE={mse:.2f}, R2={r2:.3f}")
       
       # Save model
       model_path = os.environ.get('AIP_MODEL_DIR', './model')
       os.makedirs(model_path, exist_ok=True)
       joblib.dump(model, f"{model_path}/pricing_model.joblib")
       
       print(f"Model saved to {model_path}")
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       train_pricing_model()
   EOF
   
   # Create requirements file
   cat > vertex_ai_training/requirements.txt << 'EOF'
   google-cloud-bigquery
   pandas
   scikit-learn
   joblib
   numpy
   EOF
   
   # Upload training code to Cloud Storage
   gsutil -m cp -r vertex_ai_training gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/
   
   echo "✅ Vertex AI training job prepared and uploaded"
   ```

   This advanced model uses Random Forest algorithms to capture non-linear relationships between pricing factors and outcomes. The ensemble approach provides more robust predictions and better handles complex market dynamics that linear models might miss.

5. **Deploy Vertex AI Model**:

   Model deployment on Vertex AI enables real-time inference capabilities with automatic scaling, monitoring, and versioning. This step creates a production-ready endpoint that can process pricing requests at scale while maintaining low latency for real-time pricing decisions.

   ```bash
   # Submit Vertex AI training job using autopackaging
   gcloud ai custom-jobs create \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --display-name="pricing-optimization-training" \
       --worker-pool-spec=machine-type=n1-standard-4,replica-count=1,executor-image-uri=us-docker.pkg.dev/vertex-ai/training/scikit-learn-cpu.1-0:latest,local-package-path=vertex_ai_training,script=trainer.py
   
   # Wait for training completion (this may take several minutes)
   echo "⏳ Training job submitted. Check status with:"
   echo "gcloud ai custom-jobs list --region=${REGION}"
   
   # Note: In production, you would wait for training completion 
   # and then create a model resource and endpoint for serving
   echo "✅ Vertex AI model training initiated"
   ```

   The deployed model provides enterprise-grade capabilities including A/B testing, gradual rollouts, and comprehensive monitoring. This enables safe deployment of pricing algorithms in production environments where pricing errors could have significant business impact.

6. **Create Cloud Function for Pricing Optimization**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless execution for pricing logic, automatically scaling based on demand while minimizing operational overhead. This function integrates BigQuery analytics with machine learning predictions to generate optimal pricing recommendations that consider business rules and constraints.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Function directory and code
   mkdir -p pricing_function
   cat > pricing_function/main.py << 'EOF'
   import functions_framework
   from google.cloud import bigquery
   import json
   import pandas as pd
   
   # Initialize clients
   bq_client = bigquery.Client()
   
   @functions_framework.http
   def optimize_pricing(request):
       """HTTP Cloud Function for pricing optimization."""
       try:
           request_json = request.get_json()
           product_id = request_json.get('product_id')
           
           if not product_id:
               return {'error': 'product_id is required'}, 400
           
           # Get current product data
           query = f"""
           SELECT 
               price,
               competitor_price,
               inventory_level,
               season,
               promotion
           FROM `pricing_optimization.sales_history`
           WHERE product_id = '{product_id}'
           ORDER BY sale_date DESC
           LIMIT 1
           """
           
           result = bq_client.query(query).to_dataframe()
           
           if result.empty:
               return {'error': 'Product not found'}, 404
           
           current_data = result.iloc[0]

       --memory=512Mi \
       --timeout=60s \
       --allow-unauthenticated
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Function deployed successfully"
   ```

   This serverless function implements sophisticated pricing logic that combines machine learning predictions with business rules and competitive constraints. The function can process thousands of pricing requests per minute while maintaining consistency with business objectives and market positioning.

7. **Set Up Automated Pricing Updates with Cloud Scheduler**:

   Cloud Scheduler enables automated, cron-based execution of pricing optimization workflows, ensuring that prices stay current with market conditions without manual intervention. This automation is critical for maintaining competitive advantage in fast-moving markets where optimal pricing windows may last only hours.

   ```bash
   # Get Cloud Function URL for scheduler
   FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud functions describe ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --format="value(httpsTrigger.url)")
   
   # Create Cloud Scheduler job for automated pricing updates
   gcloud scheduler jobs create http pricing-optimization-scheduler \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --schedule="0 */6 * * *" \
       --uri=${FUNCTION_URL} \
       --http-method=POST \
       --message-body='{"product_id": "PROD001"}' \
       --headers="Content-Type=application/json"
   
   # Create additional scheduled jobs for other products
   gcloud scheduler jobs create http pricing-optimization-scheduler-prod002 \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --schedule="0 */6 * * *" \
       --uri=${FUNCTION_URL} \
       --http-method=POST \
       --message-body='{"product_id": "PROD002"}' \
       --headers="Content-Type=application/json"
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Scheduler jobs created for automated pricing updates"
   echo "Pricing optimization will run every 6 hours automatically"
   ```

   The scheduler ensures continuous price optimization across your product catalog, with frequency adjusted based on market volatility and business requirements. This automation reduces the need for manual pricing decisions while ensuring rapid response to market changes and competitive actions.

8. **Configure Monitoring and Alerting**:

   Comprehensive monitoring ensures the pricing system operates reliably and provides visibility into pricing performance, model accuracy, and business impact. Cloud Monitoring enables proactive identification of issues before they affect pricing decisions or customer experience.

   ```bash
   # Create monitoring dashboard for pricing optimization
   cat > pricing_dashboard.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "displayName": "Dynamic Pricing Optimization Dashboard",
     "mosaicLayout": {
       "tiles": [
         {
           "width": 6,
           "height": 4,
           "widget": {
             "title": "Cloud Function Executions",
             "xyChart": {
               "dataSets": [
                 {
                   "timeSeriesQuery": {
                     "unitOverride": "1",
                     "timeSeriesFilter": {
                       "filter": "resource.type=\"cloud_function\"",
                       "aggregation": {
                         "alignmentPeriod": "60s",
                         "perSeriesAligner": "ALIGN_RATE"
                       }
                     }
                   }
                 }
               ]
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   # Create the dashboard
   gcloud monitoring dashboards create \
       --config-from-file=pricing_dashboard.json
   
   echo "✅ Monitoring dashboard configured"
   ```

   This monitoring setup provides real-time visibility into pricing system performance, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues that could impact pricing accuracy or business revenue.

## Validation & Testing

1. **Verify BigQuery ML Model Performance**:

   ```bash
   # Evaluate model performance
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false << 'EOF'
   SELECT
     mean_squared_error,

## Discussion

Dynamic pricing optimization represents a significant competitive advantage in modern retail and e-commerce environments. This solution demonstrates how Google Cloud's integrated machine learning and analytics services can create sophisticated pricing systems that adapt to market conditions in real-time. The combination of BigQuery ML for rapid experimentation and Vertex AI for production-grade models provides a comprehensive platform for pricing intelligence.

The architecture leverages several key Google Cloud capabilities. BigQuery serves as both the data warehouse and machine learning platform, enabling SQL practitioners to build models without extensive programming expertise. This democratization of machine learning is particularly valuable for pricing teams that understand business logic but may lack deep technical skills. Vertex AI extends these capabilities with advanced algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and production-grade model management that enterprise pricing systems require.

The serverless approach using Cloud Functions provides significant operational advantages. Pricing logic executes on-demand with automatic scaling, eliminating the need to provision and manage infrastructure for variable pricing workloads. Cloud Scheduler ensures continuous optimization without manual intervention, while Cloud Monitoring provides visibility into system performance and business impact. This operational simplicity allows pricing teams to focus on strategy rather than infrastructure management.

Real-world implementations have shown substantial business impact from machine learning-powered pricing optimization. Research indicates that businesses implementing ML-based dynamic pricing achieve margin improvements of 10% or more, with revenue increases up to 25% through better price positioning and market responsiveness. The key success factors include high-quality historical data, proper feature engineering, and integration with existing business systems and processes.

> **Tip**: Start with a limited product set to validate model performance before scaling to your entire catalog. Use A/B testing to compare ML-driven prices against current pricing strategies to measure incremental business value.

## Challenge

Extend this solution by implementing these enhancements:

1. **Multi-objective Optimization**: Modify the pricing model to simultaneously optimize for revenue, profit margins, and inventory turnover using multi-objective ML algorithms and Pareto optimization techniques in Vertex AI.

2. **Real-time Competitor Monitoring**: Integrate web scraping or competitor API data to automatically update competitor pricing in BigQuery, triggering immediate pricing adjustments based on competitive positioning.

3. **Customer Segmentation Pricing**: Enhance the model to provide personalized pricing based on customer segments, purchase history, and lifetime value using Vertex AI's recommendation systems and customer analytics.

4. **Inventory-aware Pricing**: Implement dynamic pricing that considers supply chain constraints, seasonal inventory patterns, and demand forecasting to optimize both pricing and inventory management simultaneously.

5. **Cross-product Price Elasticity**: Build advanced models that understand how price changes in one product affect demand for related products, implementing portfolio-level pricing optimization using graph neural networks in Vertex AI.
