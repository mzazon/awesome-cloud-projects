# Workload Carbon Efficiency with FinOps Hub 2.0 and Cloud Carbon Footprint

## Problem

Organizations are increasingly required to report on environmental impact while managing cloud costs effectively, but lack integrated tooling to correlate financial waste with carbon emissions. Traditional approaches treat cost optimization and sustainability initiatives as separate efforts, missing opportunities to achieve both financial and environmental efficiency simultaneously. Without automated insights linking resource utilization to carbon impact, teams struggle to prioritize optimization efforts that deliver maximum return on both cost savings and emission reductions.

## Solution

Build an intelligent carbon efficiency system that combines Google Cloud's FinOps Hub 2.0 waste insights with Cloud Carbon Footprint monitoring to automatically identify and prioritize optimization opportunities based on both financial and environmental impact. This solution leverages Gemini Cloud Assist recommendations and Cloud Monitoring automation to create a unified dashboard that correlates underutilized resources with their carbon footprint, enabling data-driven decisions that optimize both cost and sustainability metrics.

## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud project with billing account access and appropriate IAM permissions (Billing Account Administrator, Monitoring Admin, Cloud Functions Developer)
2. Google Cloud CLI installed and configured (version 400.0.0 or later)
3. Basic understanding of FinOps principles, sustainability metrics, and cloud resource optimization
4. Existing Google Cloud workloads generating billing and carbon footprint data (minimum 30 days of historical data recommended)
5. Estimated cost: $50-100 for Cloud Functions, Cloud Monitoring, and associated API calls during testing phase

> **Note**: FinOps Hub 2.0 and Cloud Carbon Footprint require no additional setup costs as they are included with Google Cloud billing accounts. The carbon footprint data may take up to 21 days to become available for new billing accounts.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="carbon-efficiency-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs for the carbon efficiency system
gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable recommender.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudscheduler.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable workflows.googleapis.com

# Get billing account ID for carbon footprint access
export BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID=$(gcloud billing accounts list \
    --format="value(name)" --limit=1)

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ Billing Account ID: ${BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID}"
```

## Steps

1. **Configure FinOps Hub 2.0 Access and Carbon Footprint Permissions**:

   FinOps Hub 2.0 represents Google Cloud's next-generation financial operations platform, providing utilization insights and waste detection capabilities powered by machine learning. The integration with Cloud Carbon Footprint enables comprehensive analysis of both financial and environmental impact, creating a unified view of resource efficiency across your cloud infrastructure.

   ```bash
   # Create service account for carbon efficiency monitoring
   gcloud iam service-accounts create carbon-efficiency-sa \
       --display-name="Carbon Efficiency Service Account" \
       --description="Service account for carbon footprint and FinOps monitoring"
   
   # Grant necessary IAM roles for billing and carbon footprint access
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:carbon-efficiency-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/billing.viewer"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:carbon-efficiency-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/recommender.viewer"
   
   # Grant monitoring and functions permissions
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:carbon-efficiency-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/monitoring.editor"
   
   echo "✅ Service account created with carbon footprint and FinOps permissions"
   ```

   The service account now has access to both financial optimization data from FinOps Hub 2.0 and environmental impact metrics from Cloud Carbon Footprint, enabling automated correlation between cost efficiency and sustainability metrics.

   echo "Navigate to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/finops"
   echo "Verify you can see utilization insights and Gemini recommendations"
   
   # Verify carbon footprint data access
   echo "Navigate to: https://console.cloud.google.com/carbon"
   echo "Confirm carbon emissions data is visible for your billing account"
   
   # Test service account permissions by listing recommendations
   gcloud recommender recommendations list \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
       --recommender=google.compute.instance.MachineTypeRecommender \
       --location=global \

   FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud functions describe carbon-efficiency-correlator \
       --region=us-central1 --format="value(httpsTrigger.url)")
   
   # Test function execution
   curl -X POST ${FUNCTION_URL} \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"action": "test_correlation"}'
   
   # Verify custom metrics creation
   gcloud monitoring metrics list \
       --filter="metric.type:custom.googleapis.com/carbon_efficiency/*" \

       --format="table(displayName,enabled,combiner)"
   
   # Verify workflow execution
   gcloud workflows executions list \
       --workflow=carbon-efficiency-workflow \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --limit=5
   
   echo "✅ Monitoring dashboard and automation validated"
   ```

   Expected output: Dashboard should be listed with carbon efficiency visualization, and alert policies should be active and properly configured.

       gcloud monitoring policies delete ${policy} --quiet
   done
   
   # Delete dashboards
   for dashboard in $(gcloud monitoring dashboards list --format="value(name)" --filter="displayName:Carbon Efficiency"); do
       gcloud monitoring dashboards delete ${dashboard} --quiet
   done
   
   echo "✅ Monitoring resources cleaned up"
   ```

3. **Remove Scheduler and Pub/Sub Resources**:

   # Delete Cloud Scheduler job
   gcloud scheduler jobs delete carbon-efficiency-scheduler \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --quiet
   
   # Delete Pub/Sub topic
   gcloud pubsub topics delete carbon-optimization \
       --quiet
   
   # Delete BigQuery dataset
   bq rm -r -f ${PROJECT_ID}:carbon_efficiency
   
   # Delete service account
   gcloud iam service-accounts delete \
       carbon-efficiency-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
       --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Scheduler, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, and IAM resources cleaned up"
   ```

4. **Clean Up Local Files and Environment Variables**:
