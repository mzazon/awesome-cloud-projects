# Quantum-Safe Security Posture Management with Security Command Center and Cloud Key Management Service

## Problem

Organizations face an imminent quantum computing threat where traditional RSA and elliptic curve cryptography will become vulnerable to quantum attacks within the next decade. Enterprise security teams lack comprehensive visibility into their cryptographic infrastructure inventory and automated mechanisms to assess, monitor, and remediate quantum-vulnerable assets before quantum computers break current encryption standards, potentially exposing sensitive data and compromising business continuity.

## Solution

Implement a quantum-resistant security posture management framework using Google Cloud's Security Command Center for centralized threat detection and compliance monitoring, integrated with Cloud KMS post-quantum cryptography (PQC) capabilities for future-proof encryption. This solution provides automated asset discovery, quantum vulnerability assessment, and continuous security monitoring while establishing cryptographic agility through NIST-standardized quantum-safe algorithms.

echo "✅ Project and APIs configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ Organization ID: ${ORGANIZATION_ID##*/}"
```

## Steps

1. **Enable Security Command Center Enterprise and Configure Organization Policies**:

   Security Command Center Enterprise provides the foundational platform for quantum-safe security posture management, offering advanced threat detection, compliance monitoring, and security posture assessment capabilities. Enabling this service at the organization level ensures comprehensive visibility across all projects and resources while establishing the governance framework necessary for quantum threat mitigation.

   ```bash
   # Create organization policy for quantum-safe requirements
   cat > quantum-security-policy.yaml << 'EOF'
   name: organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/policies/compute.requireOsLogin
   spec:
     rules:
     - enforce: true
   ---
   name: organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/policies/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation
   spec:
     rules:
     - enforce: true
   EOF
   
   # Replace placeholder with actual organization ID
   sed -i "s/ORGANIZATION_ID/${ORGANIZATION_ID##*/}/g" \
       quantum-security-policy.yaml
   
   # Apply quantum security policies
   gcloud org-policies set-policy quantum-security-policy.yaml
   
   echo "✅ Security Command Center Enterprise enabled"
   echo "✅ Organization policies configured for quantum security"
   ```

   The organization policies enforce secure baseline configurations including mandatory OS Login and service account key restrictions, creating the security foundation required for quantum-safe operations. This establishes centralized governance and ensures consistent security posture across all projects within the organization.

2. **Create Quantum-Safe Key Management Infrastructure with Post-Quantum Cryptography**:

   Cloud KMS with post-quantum cryptography provides the cryptographic foundation for quantum-resistant security. The NIST-standardized algorithms ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) and SLH-DSA-SHA2-128S (FIPS 205) offer quantum-resistant digital signatures that protect against future quantum attacks, ensuring long-term security for sensitive data and system integrity.

   ```bash
   # Create KMS keyring in the specified region
   gcloud kms keyrings create ${KMS_KEYRING_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Create post-quantum cryptography key for ML-DSA-65 (lattice-based)
   gcloud kms keys create "${KMS_KEY_NAME}-ml-dsa" \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --keyring=${KMS_KEYRING_NAME} \
       --purpose=asymmetric-signing \
       --algorithm=pq-sign-ml-dsa-65 \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Create post-quantum cryptography key for SLH-DSA (hash-based)
   gcloud kms keys create "${KMS_KEY_NAME}-slh-dsa" \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --keyring=${KMS_KEYRING_NAME} \
       --purpose=asymmetric-signing \
       --algorithm=pq-sign-slh-dsa-sha2-128s \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Note: PQC key rotation must be managed manually
   echo "✅ Post-quantum cryptography keys created with ML-DSA-65 and SLH-DSA algorithms"
   echo "✅ Manual key rotation schedule recommended for cryptographic agility"
   ```

   The post-quantum keys provide quantum-resistant digital signatures using NIST-approved algorithms, ensuring that digital signatures created today will remain secure against future quantum computers. Manual rotation planning enhances cryptographic agility, allowing rapid response to emerging quantum threats or algorithm updates.

3. **Configure Cloud Asset Inventory for Cryptographic Asset Discovery**:

   Cloud Asset Inventory provides comprehensive discovery and tracking of cryptographic assets across the Google Cloud environment. This enables security teams to identify quantum-vulnerable encryption implementations, track cryptographic key usage, and maintain an accurate inventory of assets requiring quantum-safe migration, supporting risk assessment and remediation planning.

   ```bash
   # Create Pub/Sub topic for asset change notifications first
   gcloud pubsub topics create crypto-asset-changes \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Create storage bucket for inventory exports
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} -c STANDARD -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${PROJECT_ID}-crypto-inventory
   
   # Create asset inventory feed for cryptographic resources
   gcloud asset feeds create quantum-crypto-assets \
       --organization=${ORGANIZATION_ID##*/} \
       --asset-types="cloudkms.googleapis.com/CryptoKey,cloudkms.googleapis.com/KeyRing" \
       --content-type=RESOURCE \
       --pubsub-topic=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/topics/crypto-asset-changes
   
   # Export current cryptographic asset inventory
   gcloud asset export \
       --organization=${ORGANIZATION_ID##*/} \
       --content-type=RESOURCE \
       --asset-types="cloudkms.googleapis.com/CryptoKey,cloudkms.googleapis.com/KeyRing,compute.googleapis.com/Disk" \
       --output-path=gs://${PROJECT_ID}-crypto-inventory/initial-inventory.json
   
   echo "✅ Asset inventory feed configured for cryptographic resources"
   echo "✅ Continuous monitoring enabled for encryption key changes"
   ```

   The asset inventory feed automatically tracks changes to cryptographic resources, providing real-time visibility into the organization's encryption posture. This foundation enables automated quantum vulnerability assessment and supports compliance reporting for post-quantum cryptography migration planning.

4. **Implement Security Posture Assessment with Quantum Threat Detection**:

   Security posture assessment establishes continuous monitoring for quantum vulnerabilities and cryptographic compliance. This creates automated detection of weak encryption algorithms, outdated cryptographic implementations, and non-quantum-safe configurations, enabling proactive identification and remediation of quantum security risks before they can be exploited.

   ```bash
   # Note: Security Command Center postures are managed through console
   # Create monitoring dashboard for quantum security tracking
   cat > quantum-metrics-dashboard.json << 'EOF'

                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }

                   "filter": "resource.type=\"cloudkms_keyring\"",
                   "aggregation": {
                     "alignmentPeriod": "3600s",
                     "perSeriesAligner": "ALIGN_COUNT"
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   # Create monitoring dashboard
   gcloud monitoring dashboards create \
       --config-from-file=quantum-metrics-dashboard.json \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Create notification channel for quantum security alerts
   gcloud alpha monitoring channels create \
       --display-name="Quantum Security Alerts" \
       --type=email \
       --channel-labels=email_address=admin@example.com \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   echo "✅ Quantum security monitoring dashboard implemented"
   echo "✅ Manual posture configuration via Security Command Center console required"
   ```

   The monitoring framework provides visibility into quantum security resources, automatically tracking cryptographic asset usage. Security Command Center postures require console configuration for organization-level quantum readiness assessment and compliance monitoring.

5. **Deploy Cloud Monitoring for Quantum Security Metrics**:

   Cloud Monitoring provides real-time visibility into quantum security metrics, tracking encryption algorithm usage, key rotation compliance, and post-quantum cryptography adoption rates. This observability platform enables security teams to measure quantum readiness progress, identify non-compliant resources, and demonstrate regulatory compliance for post-quantum security requirements.

   ```bash
   # Create alerting policy for quantum vulnerabilities
   cat > quantum-alert-policy.yaml << 'EOF'
   displayName: "Quantum Vulnerability Detection"
   conditions:
   - displayName: "Weak encryption detected"
     conditionThreshold:
       filter: 'resource.type="cloudkms_cryptokey" AND log_name="quantum_vulnerability_scan"'
       comparison: COMPARISON_GT
       thresholdValue: 0
       duration: 300s
   notificationChannels: []
   alertStrategy:
     autoClose: 86400s
   EOF
   
   # Apply alert policy
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies create \
       --policy-from-file=quantum-alert-policy.yaml \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Create custom metrics for quantum readiness tracking
   cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
   google-cloud-asset==3.19.0
   google-cloud-securitycenter==1.23.0
   functions-framework==3.4.0
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Quantum security monitoring dashboard deployed"
   echo "✅ Automated alerting configured for quantum vulnerabilities"
   ```

   The monitoring dashboard provides executive-level visibility into quantum security posture, enabling data-driven decision making for post-quantum cryptography migration. Real-time alerts ensure rapid response to newly discovered quantum vulnerabilities and support continuous improvement of the organization's quantum defense strategy.

6. **Configure Automated Compliance Reporting and Governance**:

   Automated compliance reporting establishes systematic documentation of quantum readiness status, supporting regulatory requirements and audit processes. This governance framework tracks post-quantum cryptography adoption, identifies compliance gaps, and generates executive reports demonstrating progress toward quantum-safe security posture across the enterprise.

   ```bash
   # Create compliance reporting function for quantum readiness
   cat > main.py << 'EOF'
   import json
   from google.cloud import asset_v1
   from google.cloud import securitycenter
   from datetime import datetime

       """Generate quarterly quantum readiness compliance report"""
       
       # Initialize clients
       asset_client = asset_v1.AssetServiceClient()
       
       # Query cryptographic assets
       org_id = request.args.get('org_id')
       parent = f"organizations/{org_id}"
       
       try:
           assets = asset_client.list_assets(
               request={"parent": parent, 
                       "filter": "assetType:cloudkms.googleapis.com/CryptoKey"}
           )
           
           # Analyze quantum readiness
           quantum_safe_keys = 0
           vulnerable_keys = 0
           
           for asset in assets:
               if "PQ_SIGN" in str(asset.asset.resource.data):
                   quantum_safe_keys += 1
               else:
                   vulnerable_keys += 1
           
           # Generate compliance report
           total_keys = quantum_safe_keys + vulnerable_keys
           readiness_score = (quantum_safe_keys / total_keys * 100) if total_keys > 0 else 0
           
           report = {
               "report_date": datetime.now().isoformat(),
               "organization_id": org_id,
