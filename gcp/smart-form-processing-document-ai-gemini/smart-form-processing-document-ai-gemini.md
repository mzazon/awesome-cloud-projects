# Smart Form Processing with Document AI and Gemini

## Problem

Organizations process thousands of forms daily, from job applications to insurance claims, requiring manual data entry that is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. Traditional OCR solutions struggle with handwritten text, varying form layouts, and data validation, creating bottlenecks that delay business processes and increase operational costs by up to 40%.

## Solution

Build an intelligent document processing system using Google Cloud's Document AI for accurate form extraction, Vertex AI Gemini for data validation and enrichment, Cloud Functions for serverless orchestration, and Cloud Storage for secure file management. This AI-powered solution automatically processes forms with 95%+ accuracy while providing intelligent validation and data enhancement.

export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable documentai.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
```

```bash
# Create Cloud Storage buckets for form processing
export BUCKET_INPUT="forms-input-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BUCKET_OUTPUT="forms-output-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
    -c STANDARD \
    -l ${REGION} \
    gs://${BUCKET_INPUT}

gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
    -c STANDARD \
    -l ${REGION} \
    gs://${BUCKET_OUTPUT}

echo "✅ Storage buckets created: ${BUCKET_INPUT}, ${BUCKET_OUTPUT}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Document AI Form Parser Processor**:

   Document AI Form Parser provides specialized capabilities for extracting structured data from forms, including handwritten text recognition and table extraction. This processor understands form layouts and can identify key-value pairs, checkboxes, and table data with high accuracy, supporting over 200 languages and complex document formats.

   ```bash
   # Create Document AI processor for form parsing using REST API
   # Note: gcloud CLI support for Document AI processors may vary by region
   PROCESSOR_JSON=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "type": "FORM_PARSER_PROCESSOR",
  "displayName": "smart-form-processor"
}
EOF
)
   
   # Create processor using REST API
   PROCESSOR_RESPONSE=$(curl -X POST \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d "${PROCESSOR_JSON}" \
       "https://${REGION}-documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${REGION}/processors")
   
   # Extract processor ID from response
   export PROCESSOR_ID=$(echo "${PROCESSOR_RESPONSE}" | \
       grep -o '"name":"[^"]*"' | \
       cut -d'"' -f4 | \
       grep -o '[^/]*$')
   
   echo "✅ Document AI processor created: ${PROCESSOR_ID}"
   ```

   The Form Parser processor is now ready to extract structured data from uploaded forms, supporting various formats including PDFs, images, and scanned documents with advanced OCR capabilities that handle challenging text including handwriting, distorted fonts, and complex layouts.
