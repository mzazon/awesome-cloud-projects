# SECURITY AND COMPATIBILITY NOTES
# ==============================================================================

# 1. All specified versions are known to be compatible with:
#    - Google Cloud Functions Python 3.12 runtime
#    - Current Google Cloud APIs and authentication methods
#    - Each other (no version conflicts)

# 2. Security considerations:
#    - All packages are from trusted sources (PyPI official packages)
#    - Versions are pinned to prevent supply chain attacks
#    - No packages with known vulnerabilities are included

# 3. Performance considerations:
#    - Minimal dependencies to reduce cold start times
#    - All dependencies are lightweight and optimized for serverless

# 4. Upgrade path:
#    - Test all upgrades in non-production environments first
#    - Monitor Google Cloud client library changelogs
#    - Functions Framework updates may require testing locally

# ==============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON DEPENDENCY ISSUES
# ==============================================================================

# Issue: ImportError for google.cloud modules
# Solution: Ensure google-cloud-monitoring is properly installed
#          and service account authentication is configured

# Issue: Functions Framework not starting locally
# Solution: Install functions-framework and use:
#          functions-framework --target=generate_status_report --debug

# Issue: SMTP authentication failures  
# Solution: Verify Gmail app password is correctly configured
#          and sender account has proper security settings

# Issue: Monitoring API access denied
# Solution: Ensure service account has roles/monitoring.viewer role
#          and proper IAM permissions are configured
