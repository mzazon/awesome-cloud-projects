## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud Project with billing enabled and sufficient quota for Compute Engine and Cloud Workstations
2. Google Cloud CLI (gcloud) installed and authenticated with project owner permissions
3. Firebase project created and linked to your Google Cloud project
4. Basic understanding of cloud development environments and Git workflows
5. Estimated cost: $50-100 per month for 5-10 active workstations during business hours

> **Note**: Cloud Workstations charges are based on compute usage and persistent disk storage. Configure auto-shutdown policies to minimize costs during off-hours.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for the project
export PROJECT_ID="dev-onboarding-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"
export CLUSTER_NAME="developer-workstations"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export CONFIG_NAME="fullstack-dev-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export REPO_NAME="team-templates-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Set default project and region for gcloud
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required Google Cloud APIs
gcloud services enable workstations.googleapis.com \
    sourcerepo.googleapis.com \
    compute.googleapis.com \
    iam.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    firebase.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ APIs enabled for workstations and source repositories"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud Source Repository for Team Templates**:

   Cloud Source Repositories provide fully managed Git repositories that integrate seamlessly with Google Cloud services, offering enhanced security and access controls. Creating a centralized template repository enables standardized project structures and promotes consistency across development teams while maintaining version control and collaboration features.

   ```bash
   # Create source repository for team project templates
   gcloud source repos create ${REPO_NAME} \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   # Clone the repository locally to add initial templates
   gcloud source repos clone ${REPO_NAME} \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   
   echo "✅ Source repository created: ${REPO_NAME}"
   ```

   The source repository is now available and ready to store team project templates, coding standards, and shared configurations. This centralized approach ensures all team members start with the same foundation while enabling collaborative development through integrated Git workflows.

2. **Create IAM Groups and Permissions for Developer Access**:

   Google Cloud Identity and Access Management provides granular access controls that support the principle of least privilege. Creating specific developer groups and roles ensures secure access to development resources while simplifying permission management as team membership changes.

   ```bash
   # Create custom IAM role for workstation users
   cat > workstation-developer-role.yaml << 'EOF'
   title: "Workstation Developer"
   description: "Access to workstations and development resources"
   stage: "GA"
   includedPermissions:
   - workstations.workstations.use
   - workstations.workstations.create
   - workstations.workstations.list
   - source.repos.get
   - source.repos.list
   - logging.logEntries.create
   EOF
   
   gcloud iam roles create workstationDeveloper \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
       --file=workstation-developer-role.yaml
   
   echo "✅ Custom IAM role created for workstation access"
   echo "✅ Configure Cloud Identity groups separately in the Admin Console"
   ```

   The IAM configuration establishes secure, role-based access controls that can scale with your team. This foundation supports automated user provisioning and ensures developers receive appropriate permissions without manual intervention from administrators.

3. **Create and Configure Workstation Cluster**:

   Cloud Workstations clusters provide the underlying infrastructure for managed development environments, offering scalable compute resources with built-in security and networking. Configuring a cluster with appropriate machine types and networking ensures optimal performance while maintaining cost efficiency through auto-scaling capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create workstation cluster with network configuration
   gcloud workstations clusters create ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --network="projects/${PROJECT_ID}/global/networks/default" \
       --subnetwork="projects/${PROJECT_ID}/regions/${REGION}/subnetworks/default" \
       --enable-private-endpoint \
       --labels=environment=development,team=engineering
   
   # Wait for cluster creation to complete
   gcloud workstations clusters describe ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --format="value(state)"
   
   echo "✅ Workstation cluster created: ${CLUSTER_NAME}"
   ```

   The workstation cluster provides a secure, scalable foundation for development environments with private networking and proper resource isolation. This infrastructure supports multiple development teams while maintaining security boundaries and cost controls.

4. **Create Workstation Configuration with Pre-installed Tools**:

   Workstation configurations define the standard development environment template, including base operating system, pre-installed tools, and resource specifications. Creating a comprehensive configuration ensures all developers start with identical, fully-equipped environments that include necessary IDEs, runtimes, and development tools.

   ```bash
   # Create comprehensive workstation configuration
   gcloud workstations configs create ${CONFIG_NAME} \
       --cluster=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --machine-type=e2-standard-4 \
       --pd-disk-size=100GB \
       --pd-disk-type=pd-standard \
       --container-image="us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-workstations-images/predefined/code-oss:latest" \
       --idle-timeout=7200s \
       --enable-audit-agent \
       --labels=environment=development,type=fullstack
   
   echo "✅ Workstation configuration created with development tools"
   ```

   The workstation configuration establishes a standardized development environment with sufficient compute resources, persistent storage, and an integrated development environment. This template ensures consistency across all developer workstations while providing the flexibility to accommodate various development workflows.

5. **Set Up Firebase Studio Integration**:

   Firebase Studio provides an AI-powered development environment that accelerates application development through intelligent code generation and project templates powered by Gemini 2.5. Integrating Firebase Studio with your workstation environment enables rapid prototyping and collaborative development with built-in access to Google Cloud services.

   ```bash
   # Initialize Firebase project connection
   gcloud firebase projects list --format="table(projectId,displayName)"
   
   # Enable Firebase APIs and services
   gcloud services enable firebase.googleapis.com \
       firebasehosting.googleapis.com \
       firestore.googleapis.com \
       firebasedatabase.googleapis.com
   
   # Create Firebase Studio workspace template metadata
   cat > firebase-studio-template.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "name": "Team Development Template",
     "description": "Standard full-stack application template for team development",
     "framework": "Next.js",
     "features": [
       "authentication",
       "database",
       "hosting",
       "cloud-functions"
     ],
     "integrations": {
       "source_repository": true,
       "cloud_workstations": true,
       "monitoring": true
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Firebase Studio integration configured"
   echo "✅ Project template metadata created for rapid development"
   ```

   Firebase Studio integration provides developers with AI-assisted development capabilities and pre-configured project templates. This accelerates the development process by automating routine tasks and providing intelligent suggestions for application architecture and implementation through Gemini's advanced AI capabilities.

6. **Create Developer Onboarding Automation Script**:

   Automation scripts streamline the new developer setup process by programmatically creating workstation instances, configuring access permissions, and provisioning development resources. This systematic approach reduces manual overhead and ensures consistent onboarding experiences across the organization.

   ```bash
   # Create onboarding automation script
   cat > onboard-developer.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   
   DEVELOPER_EMAIL=$1
   WORKSTATION_ID="${DEVELOPER_EMAIL%@*}-workstation"
   
   if [ -z "$DEVELOPER_EMAIL" ]; then
       echo "Usage: $0 <developer-email>"
       exit 1
   fi
   
   echo "🚀 Onboarding developer: $DEVELOPER_EMAIL"
   
   # Create workstation instance for the developer
   gcloud workstations create $WORKSTATION_ID \
       --cluster=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --config=${CONFIG_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --labels=owner=${DEVELOPER_EMAIL%@*},team=engineering
   
   # Grant workstation access to the developer
   gcloud workstations add-iam-policy-binding $WORKSTATION_ID \
       --cluster=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
       --config=${CONFIG_NAME} \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --member="user:$DEVELOPER_EMAIL" \
       --role="roles/workstations.user"
   
   # Grant source repository access
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="user:$DEVELOPER_EMAIL" \
       --role="roles/source.reader"
   
   echo "✅ Workstation created: $WORKSTATION_ID"
   echo "✅ Access permissions configured for $DEVELOPER_EMAIL"
   echo "📧 Send login instructions to the developer"
   EOF
   
   chmod +x onboard-developer.sh
   echo "✅ Developer onboarding automation script created"
   ```

   The automation script provides a repeatable, standardized process for onboarding new team members. This systematic approach reduces the time required for new developer setup from days to minutes while ensuring consistent access controls and resource provisioning.

7. **Configure Team Collaboration Features**:

   Team collaboration features enable distributed development teams to work effectively together through shared development environments, integrated communication tools, and collaborative debugging capabilities. These features enhance productivity by reducing context switching and facilitating knowledge sharing.

   ```bash
   # Set up shared team repository with project templates
   cd ${REPO_NAME}
   
   # Create standard project structure and templates
   mkdir -p templates/{web-app,mobile-app,api-service}
   mkdir -p docs/{onboarding,best-practices,architecture}
   mkdir -p scripts/{development,deployment,testing}
   
   # Create team development guidelines
   cat > docs/onboarding/README.md << 'EOF'

   # Set up budget alerts for workstation costs
   BILLING_ACCOUNT=$(gcloud beta billing accounts list \
       --format="value(name)" | head -1)
   
   if [ ! -z "$BILLING_ACCOUNT" ]; then
       gcloud billing budgets create \
           --billing-account=$BILLING_ACCOUNT \
           --display-name="Developer Workstations Budget" \
           --budget-amount=1000 \
           --threshold-rule=percent=75,spend-basis=current-spend \
           --threshold-rule=percent=90,spend-basis=current-spend \
           --threshold-rule=percent=100,spend-basis=current-spend \
           --credit-types-treatment=exclude-all-credits
       
       echo "✅ Budget alerts set up for cost management"
   else
       echo "⚠️ No billing account found. Set up budget alerts manually in the console"
   fi
   
   # Create monitoring policy for workstation usage
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies create \
       --policy-from-file=<(cat << 'EOF'
   displayName: "Workstation High Usage Alert"
   conditions:
   - displayName: "High workstation CPU usage"
     conditionThreshold:
       filter: 'resource.type="workstation"'
       comparison: COMPARISON_GREATER_THAN
       thresholdValue: 0.8
       duration: 300s
   notificationChannels: []
   alertStrategy:
     autoClose: 1800s
   EOF
   )
