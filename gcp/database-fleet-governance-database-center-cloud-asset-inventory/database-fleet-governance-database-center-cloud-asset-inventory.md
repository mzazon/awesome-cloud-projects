# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="db-governance-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs for database governance
gcloud services enable cloudasset.googleapis.com \
    workflows.googleapis.com \
    monitoring.googleapis.com \
    sqladmin.googleapis.com \
    spanner.googleapis.com \
    bigtableadmin.googleapis.com \
    firestore.googleapis.com \

gcloud iam service-accounts create db-governance-sa \
    --display-name="Database Governance Service Account"

export SERVICE_ACCOUNT="db-governance-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Grant necessary permissions to service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
    --role="roles/cloudasset.viewer"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
    --role="roles/workflows.invoker"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
    --role="roles/monitoring.metricWriter"

echo "✅ Project configured for database governance: ${PROJECT_ID}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Sample Database Fleet for Governance Testing**:

   Google Cloud's Database Center provides unified fleet management across diverse database services. Creating a representative sample fleet allows us to demonstrate governance capabilities across Cloud SQL, Spanner, and Bigtable instances with varying configurations that highlight different compliance and security considerations.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud SQL instance with specific configuration
   gcloud sql instances create fleet-sql-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
       --database-version=POSTGRES_15 \
       --tier=db-f1-micro \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --backup-start-time=02:00 \
       --enable-bin-log \
       --storage-auto-increase \
       --deletion-protection
   
   # Create Spanner instance for distributed database governance
   gcloud spanner instances create fleet-spanner-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
       --config=regional-${REGION} \
       --nodes=1 \
       --description="Fleet governance sample"
   
   # Create Bigtable instance for NoSQL governance
   gcloud bigtable instances create fleet-bigtable-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
       --cluster=fleet-cluster \
       --cluster-zone=${ZONE} \
       --cluster-num-nodes=1 \
       --instance-type=DEVELOPMENT
   
   echo "✅ Sample database fleet created successfully"
   ```

   The database fleet now includes representative instances across SQL, distributed, and NoSQL database types. This diverse fleet provides comprehensive testing scenarios for governance policies, security configurations, and compliance monitoring across different database architectures and use cases.

2. **Configure Cloud Asset Inventory for Database Discovery**:

   Cloud Asset Inventory maintains a time-series database of Google Cloud asset metadata with five-week history retention. Configuring asset inventory exports enables automated discovery of database resources across projects, providing the foundation for comprehensive fleet visibility and compliance monitoring.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset for asset inventory exports
   bq mk --dataset \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --description="Database fleet asset inventory" \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:database_governance
   
   # Create Cloud Storage bucket for asset exports
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://db-governance-assets-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}
   
   # Export current asset snapshot to BigQuery
   gcloud asset export \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
       --bigquery-table=${PROJECT_ID}:database_governance.asset_inventory \
       --content-type=resource \
       --asset-types="sqladmin.googleapis.com/Instance,spanner.googleapis.com/Instance,bigtableadmin.googleapis.com/Instance"
   
   # Create Pub/Sub topic for real-time asset change notifications
   gcloud pubsub topics create database-asset-changes
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Asset Inventory configured for database discovery"
   ```

   The asset inventory system now provides comprehensive database resource tracking with historical data retention and real-time change notifications. This configuration enables automated compliance monitoring, security auditing, and governance policy enforcement across the entire database fleet.

3. **Set Up Database Center AI-Powered Fleet Management**:

   Database Center leverages Google's Gemini AI models to provide intelligent fleet management with automated health assessments, security recommendations, and compliance monitoring. The AI-powered dashboard aggregates data from Security Command Center and provides customized recommendations based on Google Cloud best practices.

   ```bash
   # Configure Database Center access permissions
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="user:$(gcloud config get-value account)" \
       --role="roles/cloudsql.viewer"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="user:$(gcloud config get-value account)" \
       --role="roles/spanner.databaseReader"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="user:$(gcloud config get-value account)" \
       --role="roles/bigtable.reader"
   
   # Access Database Center dashboard
   echo "Navigate to Database Center at:"
   echo "https://console.cloud.google.com/database-center?project=${PROJECT_ID}"
   
   echo "✅ Database Center access configured with AI-powered insights"
   echo "Manual step: Access Database Center dashboard in Cloud Console"
   ```

   Database Center now provides AI-powered fleet visibility with Gemini chat interface for natural language queries about database health, security, and compliance. The integration with Security Command Center enhances threat detection and provides comprehensive security recommendations across the database fleet.

4. **Create Automated Governance Workflow**:

   Cloud Workflows orchestrates automated governance processes by responding to asset changes, evaluating compliance policies, and triggering remediation actions. This serverless workflow engine provides reliable execution of governance policies with built-in error handling and retry logic for maintaining database fleet compliance.

   ```bash
   # Create governance workflow definition
   cat > governance-workflow.yaml << 'EOF'

                             args:
                               instance: ${asset}
                     - condition: ${asset.assetType == "spanner.googleapis.com/Instance"}
                       steps:
                         - validateSpanner:
                             call: validateSpannerSecurity
                             args:
                               instance: ${asset}
       - generateReport:
           call: http.post
           args:
             url: ${"https://monitoring.googleapis.com/v3/projects/" + sys.get_env("PROJECT_ID") + "/timeSeries"}
             auth:
               type: OAuth2
             body:
               timeSeries:
                 - metric:
                     type: "custom.googleapis.com/database/governance_score"
                   points:
                     - value:
                         doubleValue: 0.95
                       interval:
                         endTime: ${time.now()}
   
   validateSQLSecurity:
     params: [instance]
     steps:
       - checkBackupConfig:
           return: ${default(instance.resource.data.settings.backupConfiguration.enabled, false)}
   
   validateSpannerSecurity:
     params: [instance]
     steps:
       - checkEncryption:
           return: ${instance.resource.data.encryptionConfig != null}
   EOF
   
   # Deploy the governance workflow
   gcloud workflows deploy database-governance-workflow \
       --source=governance-workflow.yaml \
       --service-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
   
   echo "✅ Automated governance workflow deployed successfully"
   ```

   The governance workflow now automatically evaluates database configurations against security and compliance policies, providing continuous monitoring and automated reporting. This serverless approach ensures consistent policy enforcement without manual intervention while maintaining detailed audit trails.

5. **Configure Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting**:

   Cloud Monitoring provides comprehensive observability for database governance with custom metrics, alerting policies, and dashboard visualizations. Real-time monitoring enables proactive identification of governance violations, security issues, and performance anomalies across the database fleet.

       --description="Database fleet compliance score" \
       --log-filter='resource.type="cloud_function" AND "compliance"'
   
   # Create notification channel for governance alerts
   gcloud alpha monitoring channels create \
       --display-name="Database Governance Alerts" \
       --type=email \
       --channel-labels=email_address=$(gcloud config get-value account)
   
   # Get the notification channel ID
   CHANNEL_ID=$(gcloud alpha monitoring channels list \
       --filter="displayName:Database Governance Alerts" \
       --format="value(name)")
   
   # Create alert policy for governance violations
   cat > governance-alert-policy.json << EOF
   {
     "displayName": "Database Governance Violations",
     "conditions": [
       {
         "displayName": "Low compliance score",
         "conditionThreshold": {
           "filter": "metric.type=\"logging.googleapis.com/user/database_compliance_score\"",
           "comparison": "COMPARISON_GREATER_THAN",
           "thresholdValue": 5,
           "duration": "300s"
         }
       }
     ],
     "notificationChannels": ["${CHANNEL_ID}"],
     "alertStrategy": {
       "autoClose": "1800s"
     },
     "enabled": true
   }
   EOF
   
   # Create the alert policy

           blob = bucket.blob(f"compliance-reports/{datetime.date.today()}-report.json")
           blob.upload_from_string(json.dumps(report, indent=2))
           
           return {
               'status': 'success',
               'report_location': f"gs://{bucket_name}/compliance-reports/{datetime.date.today()}-report.json",
               'compliance_percentage': report['compliance_percentage']
           }
           
       except Exception as e:
           return {'status': 'error', 'message': str(e)}
   EOF
   
   cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
   google-cloud-asset==3.19.1
   google-cloud-bigquery==3.11.4
   google-cloud-storage==2.10.0
   EOF

   # Test manual workflow execution
   gcloud workflows execute database-governance-workflow \
       --data='{"test": "governance_validation"}'
   
   # Verify Cloud Function deployment
   gcloud functions describe compliance-reporter
   ```

   Expected output: Successful workflow executions and deployed Cloud Function with proper configuration.

4. **Test Monitoring and Alerting System**:

   ```bash
   # Check custom metrics creation
   gcloud logging metrics list --filter="name:database_compliance_score"
   
   # Verify notification channels
   gcloud alpha monitoring channels list
   
   # Test governance scoring function
   curl -X GET "https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/compliance-reporter?project_id=${PROJECT_ID}&suffix=${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
   ```

   Expected output: Active metrics, notification channels, and successful compliance report generation.

## Cleanup

1. **Remove Cloud Functions and Workflows**:

   ```bash
   # Delete governance automation components
   gcloud functions delete compliance-reporter --quiet
   gcloud workflows delete database-governance-workflow --quiet
   gcloud scheduler jobs delete governance-scheduler --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Automation components deleted"
   ```

2. **Clean Up Database Fleet**:

   ```bash
   # Delete database instances (remove deletion protection first)
   gcloud sql instances patch fleet-sql-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
       --no-deletion-protection --quiet
   gcloud sql instances delete fleet-sql-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} --quiet
   
   gcloud spanner instances delete fleet-spanner-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} --quiet
   gcloud bigtable instances delete fleet-bigtable-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Database fleet cleaned up"
   ```

3. **Remove Storage and Monitoring Resources**:

   ```bash
   # Delete BigQuery dataset
   bq rm -r -f ${PROJECT_ID}:database_governance
   
   # Delete Cloud Storage bucket
   gsutil -m rm -r gs://db-governance-assets-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}
   
   # Delete Pub/Sub resources
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete governance-automation --quiet
   gcloud pubsub topics delete database-asset-changes --quiet
   
   # Delete custom metrics
   gcloud logging metrics delete database_compliance_score --quiet
   gcloud logging metrics delete governance_events --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Storage and monitoring resources removed"
   ```

4. **Clean Up IAM and Service Accounts**:

   ```bash
   # Remove service account and permissions
   gcloud iam service-accounts delete ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} --quiet
   
   # Clean up local files
   rm -rf governance-reporting governance-workflow.yaml governance-alert-policy.json
   rm -f gemini-queries.json
   
   echo "✅ IAM resources and local files cleaned up"
   ```

## Discussion

Database Center represents a significant advancement in Google Cloud's database management capabilities, leveraging Gemini AI to provide intelligent, unified fleet management across diverse database services. The AI-powered insights dramatically reduce the complexity of managing heterogeneous database environments by providing contextual recommendations, automated health assessments, and natural language interaction capabilities. This integration addresses the traditional challenge of fragmented database management tools by consolidating monitoring, optimization, and security oversight into a single, intelligent platform.

The combination of Database Center with Cloud Asset Inventory creates a powerful governance framework that provides both real-time insights and historical compliance tracking. Cloud Asset Inventory's time-series database maintains five weeks of asset metadata history, enabling trend analysis and compliance reporting over time. The automated export capabilities to BigQuery and Cloud Storage facilitate integration with existing data analytics workflows and audit systems, while Pub/Sub integration enables real-time response to configuration changes across the database fleet.

Cloud Workflows orchestration provides the automation backbone for continuous governance, enabling complex policy enforcement scenarios with built-in error handling and retry logic. The serverless nature of this approach ensures reliable execution without infrastructure management overhead while providing detailed execution logs for audit purposes. Integration with Cloud Monitoring extends this visibility to include custom governance metrics, alerting policies, and dashboard visualizations that provide stakeholders with comprehensive fleet health visibility.

The Gemini AI integration transforms database governance from a technical, command-line driven process into an accessible, conversational experience. This democratization of database management capabilities enables both technical and business stakeholders to interact with complex database governance scenarios through natural language queries, making governance policies more transparent and actionable across the organization. According to Google Cloud's [Database Center documentation](https://cloud.google.com/database-center/docs), this AI-powered approach significantly reduces the time required for fleet health assessment and policy implementation.

> **Tip**: Leverage Database Center's Gemini chat interface to create custom governance policies and get AI-powered recommendations for your specific database configurations and compliance requirements.

## Challenge

Extend this database governance solution by implementing these advanced capabilities:

1. **Multi-Cloud Database Discovery**: Integrate with external database discovery tools to include databases running on other cloud platforms and on-premises environments, creating a truly unified governance view across hybrid and multi-cloud architectures.

2. **Advanced Compliance Frameworks**: Implement automated compliance checking for specific regulatory frameworks like SOC 2, HIPAA, or PCI DSS using Cloud Security Command Center integration and custom policy engines that automatically map database configurations to compliance requirements.

3. **Predictive Governance Analytics**: Build machine learning models using Vertex AI to predict potential compliance violations, security risks, and performance issues before they occur, enabling proactive governance and preventive maintenance across the database fleet.

4. **Cost Optimization Integration**: Combine governance insights with Google Cloud's Recommender API to provide cost optimization recommendations that maintain security and compliance requirements while reducing database infrastructure costs through right-sizing and resource optimization.

5. **Enterprise Integration Workflows**: Develop integration connectors with enterprise ITSM systems, ticketing platforms, and change management tools to automatically create tickets, approvals, and remediation workflows when governance violations are detected.
