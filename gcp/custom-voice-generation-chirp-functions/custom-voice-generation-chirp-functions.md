# Custom Voice Generation with Chirp 3 and Functions

## Problem

Organizations need personalized voice experiences for customer service, accessibility applications, and content creation but face challenges with traditional text-to-speech systems that sound robotic and lack natural human-like intonation. Creating custom voices typically requires extensive audio data collection and complex training processes, making it impractical for most businesses to implement personalized voice solutions at scale.

## Solution

Implement a serverless voice generation system using Google Cloud's Chirp 3: HD voices, which provide natural human-like quality with advanced audio controls and support for real-time synthesis. The solution combines Cloud Functions for processing requests, Cloud Storage for audio management, and Cloud SQL for voice profile metadata, enabling instant custom voice creation and high-quality audio generation with minimal infrastructure overhead.

2. Google Cloud CLI installed and configured (or Cloud Shell)
3. Basic understanding of serverless functions and audio processing
4. Node.js 18+ for local function development
5. Estimated cost: $15-25 for resources created during this recipe

> **Note**: Chirp 3: HD voices use cutting-edge LLMs to deliver unparalleled realism and emotional resonance with 30 distinct voice styles across many languages.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="voice-gen-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export BUCKET_NAME="voice-audio-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export FUNCTION_NAME="voice-synthesis-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export DB_INSTANCE="voice-profiles-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable texttospeech.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable eventarc.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ APIs enabled successfully"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket for Audio Files**:

   Google Cloud Storage provides unified object storage with global edge caching and strong consistency guarantees. Creating a bucket with appropriate location and storage class settings establishes the foundation for storing voice samples and generated audio files while maintaining high performance and cost efficiency.

   ```bash
   # Create storage bucket for audio files
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Enable versioning for audio file protection
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Create directory structure for organization
   echo "Creating audio storage structure..."
   gsutil -m cp /dev/null gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/samples/.keep
   gsutil -m cp /dev/null gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/generated/.keep
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Storage bucket created: ${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket is now ready with versioning enabled and organized directory structure, providing scalable audio file management with built-in redundancy and global accessibility.

2. **Set Up Cloud SQL Database for Voice Profiles**:

   Cloud SQL provides fully managed relational database services with automatic backups, high availability, and seamless scaling. The database will store voice profile metadata, synthesis parameters, and usage analytics while maintaining ACID compliance and enterprise-grade security.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud SQL instance for voice profile metadata
   gcloud sql instances create ${DB_INSTANCE} \
       --database-version=POSTGRES_15 \
       --tier=db-f1-micro \
       --region=${REGION} \
       --storage-type=SSD \
       --storage-size=10GB \
       --backup \
       --enable-ip-alias
   
   # Set database root password
   DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
   gcloud sql users set-password postgres \
       --instance=${DB_INSTANCE} \
       --password=${DB_PASSWORD}
   
   # Create application database
   gcloud sql databases create voice_profiles \
       --instance=${DB_INSTANCE}
   
   echo "✅ Cloud SQL instance created: ${DB_INSTANCE}"
   echo "Database password: ${DB_PASSWORD}"
   ```

   The Cloud SQL database is now configured with automated backups and secure password authentication, ready to store voice profile metadata and synthesis configurations.

3. **Create Voice Profile Management Function**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless event processing that automatically scales based on demand. This function will manage voice profile creation, updates, and retrieval while integrating with Cloud SQL for persistent data storage and Cloud Storage for audio file management.

   ```bash
   # Create function source directory
   mkdir -p voice-functions/profile-manager
   cd voice-functions/profile-manager
   
   # Create package.json for dependencies
   cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "voice-profile-manager",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@google-cloud/functions-framework": "^3.3.0",
    "@google-cloud/storage": "^7.7.0",
    "pg": "^8.11.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
EOF
   
   # Create voice profile management function
   cat > index.js << 'EOF'
const functions = require('@google-cloud/functions-framework');
const {Storage} = require('@google-cloud/storage');
const {Client} = require('pg');

const storage = new Storage();
const bucketName = process.env.BUCKET_NAME;

// Database configuration

  host: `/cloudsql/${process.env.PROJECT_ID}:${process.env.REGION}:${process.env.DB_INSTANCE}`,
  user: 'postgres',
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: 'voice_profiles'
};

functions.http('profileManager', async (req, res) => {
  const client = new Client(dbConfig);
  
  try {
    await client.connect();
    
    // Initialize database table if not exists
    await client.query(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS voice_profiles (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        profile_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        voice_style VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        language_code VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        audio_sample_path VARCHAR(500),
        synthesis_config JSONB
      )
    `);
    
    switch (req.method) {
      case 'POST':
        const {profileName, voiceStyle, languageCode, synthesisConfig} = req.body;
        
        const result = await client.query(
          'INSERT INTO voice_profiles (profile_name, voice_style, language_code, synthesis_config) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4) RETURNING *',
          [profileName, voiceStyle, languageCode, JSON.stringify(synthesisConfig)]
        );
        
        res.json({
          success: true,
          profile: result.rows[0],
          message: 'Voice profile created successfully'
        });
        break;
        
      case 'GET':
        const profiles = await client.query('SELECT * FROM voice_profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC');
        res.json({
          success: true,
          profiles: profiles.rows
        });
        break;
        
      default:
        res.status(405).json({error: 'Method not allowed'});
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Profile management error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({error: error.message});
  } finally {
    await client.end();
  }
});
EOF
   
   echo "✅ Voice profile management function created"
   ```

   The profile management function is now ready with database integration, providing RESTful endpoints for creating and retrieving voice profiles with automated database schema initialization.

    "pg": "^8.11.3"
  }
}
EOF
   
   # Create voice synthesis function with Chirp 3 support
   cat > index.js << 'EOF'
const functions = require('@google-cloud/functions-framework');
const textToSpeech = require('@google-cloud/text-to-speech');
const {Storage} = require('@google-cloud/storage');
const {Client} = require('pg');
const crypto = require('crypto');

const ttsClient = new textToSpeech.TextToSpeechClient();
const storage = new Storage();
const bucketName = process.env.BUCKET_NAME;

functions.http('voiceSynthesis', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const {text, profileId, voiceStyle = 'en-US-Chirp3-HD-Achernar'} = req.body;
    
    if (!text) {
      return res.status(400).json({error: 'Text is required'});
    }
    
    // Configure Chirp 3: HD voice synthesis request
    const request = {
      input: {text: text},
      voice: {
        name: voiceStyle,
        languageCode: 'en-US'
      },
      audioConfig: {
        audioEncoding: 'MP3',
        speakingRate: 1.0,
        pitch: 0.0,
        volumeGainDb: 0.0,
        effectsProfileId: ['telephony-class-application']
      }
    };
    
    // Perform text-to-speech synthesis
    console.log('Synthesizing speech with Chirp 3:', voiceStyle);
    const [response] = await ttsClient.synthesizeSpeech(request);
    
    // Generate unique filename for audio output
    const audioId = crypto.randomUUID();
    const fileName = `generated/voice_${audioId}.mp3`;
    
    // Upload synthesized audio to Cloud Storage
    const file = storage.bucket(bucketName).file(fileName);
    await file.save(response.audioContent, {
      metadata: {
        contentType: 'audio/mp3',
        metadata: {
          profileId: profileId || 'default',
          voiceStyle: voiceStyle,
          synthesizedAt: new Date().toISOString()
        }
      }
    });
    
    // Generate signed URL for audio access
    const [signedUrl] = await file.getSignedUrl({
      action: 'read',
      expires: Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 24 hours
    });
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      audioId: audioId,
      audioUrl: signedUrl,
      fileName: fileName,
      voiceStyle: voiceStyle,

       -d '{
         "profileName": "customer-service-assistant",
         "voiceStyle": "en-US-Chirp3-HD-Achernar",
         "languageCode": "en-US",
         "synthesisConfig": {
           "speakingRate": 1.0,
           "pitch": 0.0,
           "volumeGainDb": 2.0
         }
       }'
   
   # Test voice synthesis with sample text
   curl -X POST ${SYNTHESIS_URL} \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "text": "Welcome to our customer service. How may I assist you today? I am here to help with any questions or concerns you may have.",
