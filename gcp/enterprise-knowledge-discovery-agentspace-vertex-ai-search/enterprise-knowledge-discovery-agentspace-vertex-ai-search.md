gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"
echo "✅ Required APIs enabled"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket for Document Repository**:

   Google Cloud Storage provides unified object storage with global edge caching and strong consistency guarantees. Creating a bucket with appropriate location and storage class settings establishes the foundation for a document repository that can scale from gigabytes to exabytes while maintaining high performance and cost efficiency for enterprise knowledge systems.

   ```bash
   # Create storage bucket for enterprise documents
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Enable versioning for document protection
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Set up lifecycle policy for cost optimization
   cat > lifecycle.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "rule": [
       {
         "action": {"type": "SetStorageClass", "storageClass": "NEARLINE"},
         "condition": {"age": 30}
       },
       {
         "action": {"type": "SetStorageClass", "storageClass": "COLDLINE"},
         "condition": {"age": 90}
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF
   
   gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Storage bucket created: gs://${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket is now ready with versioning enabled and automated lifecycle management, providing both data protection and cost optimization. This foundational component supports the entire knowledge discovery pipeline, from document ingestion through search and analytics.

2. **Upload Sample Enterprise Documents**:

   Document ingestion is the first step in creating a comprehensive knowledge base. By uploading diverse document types with proper metadata and organization, we establish a structured repository that Vertex AI Search can efficiently index and semantic search capabilities can leverage for accurate retrieval.

   ```bash
   # Create sample enterprise documents
   mkdir -p sample_docs
   
   # Generate HR policy document
   cat > sample_docs/hr_policy.txt << 'EOF'

   EOF
   
   # Upload documents to Cloud Storage
   gsutil -m cp sample_docs/*.txt gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/documents/
   
   echo "✅ Sample documents uploaded to storage bucket"
   ```

   The enterprise document repository is now populated with representative content spanning HR policies, technical documentation, and financial reports. This diverse content provides the foundation for testing semantic search capabilities and knowledge discovery workflows.

3. **Create BigQuery Dataset for Analytics**:

   BigQuery serves as the analytical backbone for enterprise knowledge discovery, providing serverless data warehousing capabilities that can process petabytes of data with sub-second query performance. Creating a dedicated dataset enables tracking of search patterns, user behaviors, and content effectiveness metrics.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset for search analytics
   bq mk --dataset \
       --description "Enterprise knowledge discovery analytics" \
       --location=${REGION} \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   # Create table for search queries and results
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.search_queries \
       query_id:STRING,user_id:STRING,query_text:STRING,timestamp:TIMESTAMP,results_count:INTEGER,click_through_rate:FLOAT
   
   # Create table for document usage analytics
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.document_analytics \
       document_id:STRING,document_name:STRING,view_count:INTEGER,last_accessed:TIMESTAMP,relevance_score:FLOAT
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery dataset created: ${DATASET_NAME}"
   ```

   The analytics infrastructure is now ready to capture and analyze search patterns, enabling continuous improvement of the knowledge discovery system through data-driven insights and performance optimization.

4. **Create Vertex AI Search Application**:

   Vertex AI Search leverages Google's semantic search technologies to provide enterprise-grade search capabilities with automatic content understanding, relevance ranking, and personalization. The search application serves as the core retrieval engine that powers intelligent knowledge discovery.

   ```bash
   # Create Vertex AI Search data store
   gcloud alpha discovery-engine data-stores create \
       --data-store-id=${SEARCH_APP_ID} \
       --display-name="Enterprise Knowledge Search" \
       --industry-vertical=GENERIC \
       --solution-type=SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH \
       --content-config=CONTENT_REQUIRED \
       --location=global
   
   # Import documents from Cloud Storage
   gcloud alpha discovery-engine documents import \
       --data-store=${SEARCH_APP_ID} \
       --location=global \
       --gcs-uri=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/documents/* \
       --id-field=uri
   
   # Create search engine
   gcloud alpha discovery-engine engines create \
       --engine-id=${SEARCH_APP_ID}-engine \
       --display-name="Enterprise Knowledge Engine" \
       --data-store-ids=${SEARCH_APP_ID} \
       --location=global \
       --industry-vertical=GENERIC \
       --solution-type=SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH
   
   echo "✅ Vertex AI Search application created"
   echo "✅ Document import initiated (may take 10-15 minutes)"
   ```

   The Vertex AI Search application is now configured and beginning document ingestion. The system will automatically extract text, generate embeddings, and create searchable indices that enable semantic matching beyond simple keyword searches.

5. **Configure Search Index and Embeddings**:

   Search index configuration and embeddings generation are critical for semantic understanding of enterprise content. This step optimizes the search system for domain-specific terminology, document relationships, and contextual relevance that drives accurate knowledge discovery.

   ```bash
   # Wait for document import to complete
   echo "Waiting for document import to complete..."
   sleep 180
   
   # Check import status
   gcloud alpha discovery-engine operations list \
       --location=global \
       --filter="metadata.type:IMPORT_DOCUMENTS"
   
   # Configure search settings for better relevance
   cat > search_config.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "searchTier": "SEARCH_TIER_STANDARD",
     "searchAddOns": ["SEARCH_ADD_ON_LLM"],
     "enableAutoLanguageDetection": true,
     "enablePersonalization": true,
     "enableSearchResultsOrdering": true
   }
   EOF
   
   # Apply search configuration
   gcloud alpha discovery-engine engines patch \
       ${SEARCH_APP_ID}-engine \
       --location=global \
       --update-mask=searchEngineConfig \
       --search-engine-config-from-file=search_config.json
   
   echo "✅ Search index configured with enhanced features"
   ```

   The search index is now optimized for enterprise knowledge discovery with advanced features including language detection, personalization, and LLM-powered result enhancement. These capabilities enable more accurate and contextually relevant search results.

6. **Set up Google Agentspace Enterprise Integration**:

   Google Agentspace Enterprise provides the intelligent agent layer that orchestrates search capabilities, synthesizes results, and delivers personalized knowledge discovery experiences. This integration works through the Google Cloud Console and Agentspace Enterprise web interface.

   ```bash
   # Note: Agentspace Enterprise is primarily configured through 
   # the Google Cloud Console web interface
   echo "Setting up Agentspace Enterprise configuration..."
   
   # Create configuration template for Agentspace
   cat > agentspace_setup.md << 'EOF'
   # Agentspace Enterprise Setup Instructions
   
   ## Steps to configure in Google Cloud Console:
   1. Navigate to Agentspace Enterprise in Google Cloud Console
   2. Create a new Agentspace Enterprise app
   3. Connect the Vertex AI Search engine created in previous steps
   4. Configure search settings and personalization
   5. Set up user access and permissions
   
   ## Key Configuration Values:
   - Search Engine ID: ${SEARCH_APP_ID}-engine
   - Data Store ID: ${SEARCH_APP_ID}
   - Project ID: ${PROJECT_ID}
   - Region: global
   
   ## Required URLs for setup:
   - Agentspace Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/agentspace
   - Search Engine: projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/global/engines/${SEARCH_APP_ID}-engine
   EOF
   
   # Create IAM service account for Agentspace integration
   gcloud iam service-accounts create agentspace-service \
       --description="Service account for Agentspace Enterprise" \
       --display-name="Agentspace Service Account"
   
   # Grant necessary permissions
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:agentspace-service@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/discoveryengine.editor"
   
   echo "✅ Agentspace Enterprise setup template created"
   echo "Please follow instructions in agentspace_setup.md to complete setup"
   ```

   The Agentspace integration setup is now prepared with the necessary service account and permissions. The actual Agentspace Enterprise configuration must be completed through the Google Cloud Console web interface for security and compliance reasons.

7. **Configure IAM and Access Controls**:

   Enterprise knowledge discovery requires robust access controls to ensure sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users. This step implements role-based access control (RBAC) and integrates with existing enterprise identity systems.

   ```bash
   # Create custom IAM roles for knowledge discovery
   cat > knowledge_reader_role.yaml << 'EOF'
   title: "Knowledge Discovery Reader"
   description: "Can search and read enterprise knowledge"

     - discoveryengine.dataStores.get
     - storage.objects.get
     - bigquery.tables.get
     - bigquery.tables.getData
   EOF
   
   # Create knowledge administrator role
   cat > knowledge_admin_role.yaml << 'EOF'
   title: "Knowledge Discovery Administrator"
   description: "Can manage enterprise knowledge systems"
   stage: "GA"
   includedPermissions:
     - discoveryengine.*
     - storage.objects.*
     - bigquery.datasets.*
     - bigquery.tables.*
   EOF
   
   # Create IAM roles
   gcloud iam roles create knowledgeDiscoveryReader \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
       --file=knowledge_reader_role.yaml
   
   gcloud iam roles create knowledgeDiscoveryAdmin \
       --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
       --file=knowledge_admin_role.yaml
   
   # Create service account for application access
   gcloud iam service-accounts create knowledge-discovery-sa \
       --description="Service account for knowledge discovery system" \
       --display-name="Knowledge Discovery Service Account"
   
   # Grant necessary permissions
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:knowledge-discovery-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="projects/${PROJECT_ID}/roles/knowledgeDiscoveryReader"
   
   echo "✅ IAM roles and access controls configured"
   ```

   The security framework is now established with granular access controls and service account authentication. This ensures that knowledge discovery capabilities are properly secured while maintaining ease of use for authorized personnel.

8. **Create Analytics Dashboard and Monitoring**:

   ('doc1', 'hr_policy.txt', 25, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 0.85),
   ('doc2', 'api_documentation.txt', 18, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 0.92),
   ('doc3', 'financial_report.txt', 12, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 0.78)"
   
   # Create monitoring dashboard configuration
   cat > monitoring_config.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "displayName": "Enterprise Knowledge Discovery Dashboard",
     "mosaicLayout": {
       "tiles": [
         {
           "width": 6,

           "widget": {
             "title": "Search Query Volume",
             "xyChart": {
               "dataSets": [{
                 "timeSeriesQuery": {
                   "unitOverride": "1",
                   "outputFullResourceType": false
                 }
               }]
             }
           }
         },
         {
           "width": 6,
           "height": 4,
           "widget": {
             "title": "Document Access Patterns",
             "xyChart": {
               "dataSets": [{
                 "timeSeriesQuery": {
                   "unitOverride": "1",
                   "outputFullResourceType": false
                 }
               }]
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   # Create Cloud Monitoring dashboard
   gcloud monitoring dashboards create \

## Discussion

This recipe demonstrates the power of combining Google Agentspace Enterprise with Vertex AI Search to create an intelligent enterprise knowledge discovery system. The solution leverages Google's advanced semantic search capabilities, built on decades of search expertise, to provide contextually relevant results from enterprise content repositories.

The integration of Agentspace Enterprise adds conversational AI capabilities that transform traditional search into an interactive knowledge discovery experience. Users can ask complex questions in natural language and receive synthesized answers that draw from multiple sources, complete with proper citations and confidence scores. This approach significantly reduces the time employees spend searching for information and increases the likelihood of discovering relevant insights.

The architecture provides several key advantages for enterprise deployments. First, the serverless nature of Vertex AI Search eliminates the need for complex infrastructure management while automatically scaling to handle varying query loads. Second, the integration with BigQuery enables sophisticated analytics and reporting capabilities that help organizations understand how knowledge is being accessed and utilized. Third, the robust IAM integration ensures that sensitive information remains protected while providing seamless access to authorized users.

From a cost optimization perspective, the solution uses Google Cloud's pay-as-you-go model, where organizations only pay for actual usage rather than maintaining expensive always-on infrastructure. The Cloud Storage lifecycle policies automatically optimize storage costs by moving infrequently accessed documents to cheaper storage tiers.

> **Tip**: For production deployments, consider implementing automated content ingestion pipelines using Cloud Functions or Cloud Run to keep the knowledge base current as new documents are created or updated across your enterprise systems.

The system's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and organization of the source content. Organizations should establish clear content governance policies, implement consistent metadata standards, and regularly audit the knowledge base to ensure accuracy and relevance. Additionally, monitoring user search patterns and feedback helps identify gaps in the knowledge base and opportunities for improvement.
