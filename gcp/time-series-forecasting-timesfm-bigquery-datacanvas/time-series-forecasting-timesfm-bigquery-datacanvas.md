## Steps

1. **Create BigQuery Dataset and Sample Financial Data**:

   BigQuery provides a serverless, highly scalable data warehouse optimized for analytics workloads. Creating a dedicated dataset for financial forecasting establishes the foundation for organizing time series data with proper schema design and access controls. This approach enables efficient querying and integrates seamlessly with TimesFM's data requirements.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset for time series data
   bq mk --dataset \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --description="Financial time series forecasting dataset" \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   # Create sample financial time series table
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
   CREATE TABLE \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.stock_prices\` (
     date DATE,
     symbol STRING,
     close_price FLOAT64,
     volume INT64,
     market_cap FLOAT64
   )
   PARTITION BY date
   CLUSTER BY symbol"
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery dataset and tables created"
   ```

   The partitioned and clustered table structure optimizes query performance for time series analysis while ensuring cost-effective data storage. Partitioning by date enables efficient time-based filtering, while clustering by symbol improves performance for multi-symbol forecasting scenarios.

2. **Load Historical Financial Data**:

   TimesFM requires properly formatted time series data with consistent intervals and sufficient historical context. Loading representative financial data establishes the baseline for training and forecasting, while demonstrating real-world data patterns that TimesFM can effectively analyze without additional preprocessing.

   ```bash
   # Insert sample financial time series data
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
   INSERT INTO \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.stock_prices\` VALUES
   ('2023-01-01', 'AAPL', 182.01, 52220000, 2900000000000),
   ('2023-01-02', 'AAPL', 178.85, 54930000, 2850000000000),
   ('2023-01-03', 'AAPL', 177.04, 69540000, 2820000000000),

   ('2023-01-05', 'AAPL', 179.58, 63470000, 2860000000000),
   ('2023-01-01', 'GOOGL', 89.12, 25350000, 1120000000000),
   ('2023-01-02', 'GOOGL', 88.73, 28420000, 1115000000000),
   ('2023-01-03', 'GOOGL', 89.37, 30280000, 1123000000000),
   ('2023-01-04', 'GOOGL', 91.05, 28950000, 1144000000000),
   ('2023-01-05', 'GOOGL', 90.33, 26780000, 1135000000000)"
   
   # Generate additional synthetic data for comprehensive testing
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
   INSERT INTO \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.stock_prices\`
   SELECT 
     DATE_ADD('2023-01-05', INTERVAL row_number OVER() DAY) as date,
     symbol,
     close_price * (1 + (RAND() - 0.5) * 0.1) as close_price,
     CAST(volume * (1 + (RAND() - 0.5) * 0.3) AS INT64) as volume,
     market_cap * (1 + (RAND() - 0.5) * 0.1) as market_cap
   FROM (
     SELECT 'AAPL' as symbol, 179.58 as close_price, 63470000 as volume, 2860000000000 as market_cap
     UNION ALL
     SELECT 'GOOGL', 90.33, 26780000, 1135000000000
   ) base
   CROSS JOIN UNNEST(GENERATE_ARRAY(1, 90)) as row_number"
   
   echo "✅ Historical financial data loaded successfully"
   ```

   The synthetic data generation creates realistic price movements and volume patterns that mirror actual financial time series behavior.

        # Insert data into BigQuery
        project_id = client.project
        table_id = f"{project_id}.financial_forecasting.stock_prices"
        
        rows_to_insert = [{
            'date': request_json['date'],
            'symbol': request_json['symbol'],
            'close_price': float(request_json['close_price']),
            'volume': int(request_json['volume']),
            'market_cap': float(request_json.get('market_cap', 0))
        }]
        
        errors = client.insert_rows_json(table_id, rows_to_insert)
        if errors:
            logging.error(f"BigQuery insert errors: {errors}")
            return {'error': 'Failed to insert data'}, 500
        
        # Check if we should trigger forecasting
        if should_trigger_forecast(client, request_json['symbol']):
            trigger_forecast(client, request_json['symbol'])
        
        return {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Data processed successfully'}
        
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Processing error: {str(e)}")
        return {'error': str(e)}, 500

def should_trigger_forecast(client, symbol):
    """Determine if we should trigger a new forecast."""
    # Trigger forecast if we have enough recent data points
    query = f"""
    SELECT COUNT(*) as count
    FROM `{client.project}.financial_forecasting.stock_prices`
    WHERE symbol = '{symbol}' 
    AND date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    """
    
    result = client.query(query).to_dataframe()
    return result['count'].iloc[0] >= 20

def trigger_forecast(client, symbol):
    """Trigger TimesFM forecasting for the symbol."""
    logging.info(f"Triggering forecast for {symbol}")
    # Implementation for forecast triggering will be added in later steps
    pass

   # Note: DataCanvas is primarily created through the UI, but we can prepare the data structure
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
   CREATE VIEW \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.forecast_ready_data\` AS
   SELECT 
     date,
     symbol,
     close_price,
     LAG(close_price, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY date) as prev_close,
     (close_price - LAG(close_price, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY date)) / 
     LAG(close_price, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY date) * 100 as daily_return,
     volume,
     market_cap
   FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.stock_prices\`

   SELECT 
     symbol,
     forecast_timestamp,
     forecast_value,
     prediction_interval_lower_bound,
     prediction_interval_upper_bound,
     confidence_level
   FROM AI.FORECAST(
     TABLE \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.stock_prices\`,
     data_col => 'close_price',
     timestamp_col => 'date',
     model => 'TimesFM 2.0',
     id_cols => ['symbol'],
     horizon => 7,
     confidence_level => 0.95
   )"

       --uri=${FUNCTION_URL} \
       --http-method=POST \
       --headers="Content-Type=application/json" \
       --message-body='{"action": "daily_forecast", "symbols": ["AAPL", "GOOGL"]}' \
       --time-zone="America/New_York" \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --description="Daily automated financial forecasting"
   
   # Create job for forecast accuracy monitoring
   gcloud scheduler jobs create http "forecast-monitor-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --schedule="0 18 * * *" \
       --uri=${FUNCTION_URL} \
       --http-method=POST \
       --headers="Content-Type=application/json" \
       --message-body='{"action": "monitor_accuracy"}' \

     FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.timesfm_forecasts\` f
     LEFT JOIN \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.stock_prices\` a
       ON f.symbol = a.symbol 
       AND DATE(f.forecast_timestamp) = a.date
   )
   SELECT 
     symbol,
     date,
     forecast_value,
     actual_value,
     absolute_error,
     percentage_error,
     CASE 
       WHEN actual_value BETWEEN prediction_interval_lower_bound AND prediction_interval_upper_bound 
       THEN 'Within Confidence Interval' 
       ELSE 'Outside Confidence Interval' 
     END as accuracy_status,
     prediction_interval_lower_bound,
     prediction_interval_upper_bound
   FROM actual_vs_forecast"

   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.trend_analysis\` AS
   SELECT 
     symbol,
     date,
     close_price,
     AVG(close_price) OVER (
       PARTITION BY symbol 
       ORDER BY date 
       ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
     ) as seven_day_avg,
     AVG(close_price) OVER (
       PARTITION BY symbol 
       ORDER BY date 
       ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
     ) as thirty_day_avg,
     STDDEV(close_price) OVER (
       PARTITION BY symbol 
       ORDER BY date 
       ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
     ) as volatility
   FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.stock_prices\`"

   SELECT 
     symbol,
     DATE(forecast_timestamp) as metric_date,
     AVG(percentage_error) as avg_percentage_error,
     STDDEV(percentage_error) as error_std_dev,
     COUNT(*) as forecast_count,
     SUM(CASE WHEN accuracy_status = 'Within Confidence Interval' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100 as accuracy_rate
   FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.forecast_analytics\`
   WHERE actual_value IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY symbol, DATE(forecast_timestamp)"
   
   # Create alerting query for unusual forecast errors
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.alert_conditions\` AS
   SELECT 
     symbol,
     metric_date,
     avg_percentage_error,
     accuracy_rate,
     CASE 
       WHEN avg_percentage_error > 15 THEN 'HIGH_ERROR'
       WHEN accuracy_rate < 70 THEN 'LOW_ACCURACY'
       ELSE 'NORMAL'
     END as alert_level
   FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.forecast_metrics\`
   WHERE metric_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)"

## Discussion

This intelligent forecasting solution demonstrates the power of combining Google's TimesFM foundation model with BigQuery DataCanvas to create an enterprise-grade time series forecasting system. TimesFM eliminates the traditional barriers to accurate forecasting by leveraging pre-training on billions of time points from diverse real-world datasets, enabling immediate deployment without domain-specific model training or feature engineering. The foundation model's decoder-only architecture, developed by Google Research and presented at ICML 2024, represents a significant advancement in time series foundation models.

BigQuery DataCanvas revolutionizes the analytics workflow by enabling natural language interactions with complex time series data. Business analysts can now ask questions like "Show me the forecast accuracy for AAPL over the last month" or "Which stocks have the highest volatility?" without writing SQL queries. This democratization of analytics capabilities accelerates decision-making processes while maintaining the sophisticated analytical capabilities required for financial forecasting. The integration with BigQuery's unified data platform enables seamless access to both historical data and forecast results.

The serverless architecture using Cloud Functions Generation 2 and Cloud Scheduler provides automatic scaling and cost optimization for real-time data processing. The system handles varying data volumes efficiently while maintaining low latency for critical financial updates. Cloud Monitoring integration ensures comprehensive observability, tracking both system performance and forecast accuracy metrics to maintain the reliability standards required for financial decision-making. The automated alerting system enables proactive response to accuracy degradation or system issues.

The solution's modular design enables easy extension to additional financial instruments, alternative data sources, and custom business logic. Organizations can integrate external market data feeds, economic indicators, or proprietary datasets to enhance forecasting accuracy. The standardized BigQuery interface ensures compatibility with existing data infrastructure and business intelligence tools, facilitating organization-wide adoption of advanced forecasting capabilities.

> **Tip**: Use BigQuery's time-travel capabilities to compare forecast accuracy across different model versions and fine-tune the forecasting horizon based on your specific business requirements and market volatility patterns.
