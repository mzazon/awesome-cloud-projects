# Disaster Recovery Orchestration with Cloud WAN and Parallelstore

## Problem

Enterprises running high-performance computing (HPC) and data-intensive workloads face critical challenges in maintaining business continuity during outages or disasters. Traditional backup solutions cannot meet the performance requirements of HPC applications that demand sub-millisecond latency and sustained throughput of multiple gigabytes per second. Organizations struggle to replicate and failover complex stateful workloads across regions while maintaining data consistency and minimizing recovery time objectives (RTOs) below 15 minutes.

## Solution

This solution implements an intelligent disaster recovery orchestration system using Network Connectivity Center's global network backbone to coordinate high-performance data replication between Parallelstore instances across multiple regions. Cloud Workflows automates the detection, orchestration, and failover processes, while Cloud Monitoring provides real-time health assessment and triggers automated responses to ensure business continuity for mission-critical HPC workloads.

echo "✅ Secondary region: ${SECONDARY_REGION}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create VPC Networks with Cloud WAN Integration**:

   Google Cloud WAN through Network Connectivity Center provides the foundational global network infrastructure for disaster recovery orchestration. By establishing dedicated VPC networks in each region with appropriate subnetting and routing, we create isolated environments that can communicate through the high-performance global backbone while maintaining security boundaries essential for production HPC workloads.

   ```bash
   # Create primary region VPC network
   gcloud compute networks create ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpc \
       --subnet-mode=custom \
       --description="Primary region VPC for HPC DR"
   
   # Create primary region subnet with large address space for HPC
   gcloud compute networks subnets create ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-subnet \
       --network=${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpc \
       --range=10.1.0.0/16 \
       --region=${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --description="Primary subnet for HPC workloads"
   
   # Create secondary region VPC network
   gcloud compute networks create ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpc \
       --subnet-mode=custom \
       --description="Secondary region VPC for HPC DR"
   
   # Create secondary region subnet
   gcloud compute networks subnets create ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-subnet \
       --network=${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpc \
       --range=10.2.0.0/16 \
       --region=${SECONDARY_REGION} \
       --description="Secondary subnet for HPC workloads"
   
   echo "✅ VPC networks created for both regions"
   ```

   The VPC networks are now established with non-overlapping IP ranges, providing the network foundation for high-performance data replication between regions. The large /16 subnets accommodate extensive HPC cluster deployments while maintaining clear network boundaries for security and traffic isolation.

2. **Establish Cloud WAN Connectivity Hub**:

   Network Connectivity Center serves as the central orchestration point for global network connectivity, enabling Cloud WAN functionality that provides optimized routing and bandwidth allocation between regions. This hub-and-spoke model ensures that disaster recovery traffic receives priority routing through Google's global network infrastructure.

   ```bash
   # Create Network Connectivity Center hub
   gcloud network-connectivity hubs create ${DR_PREFIX}-wan-hub \
       --description="Global WAN hub for HPC disaster recovery"
   
   # Create primary region spoke
   gcloud network-connectivity spokes create ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-spoke \
       --hub=${DR_PREFIX}-wan-hub \
       --vpc-network=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/global/networks/${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpc \
       --region=${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --description="Primary region spoke"
   
   # Create secondary region spoke
   gcloud network-connectivity spokes create ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-spoke \
       --hub=${DR_PREFIX}-wan-hub \
       --vpc-network=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/global/networks/${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpc \
       --region=${SECONDARY_REGION} \
       --description="Secondary region spoke"
   
   echo "✅ Cloud WAN hub and spokes configured"
   ```

   The Network Connectivity Center hub now provides centralized control and optimized routing between regions, enabling the Cloud WAN functionality that ensures consistent, low-latency connectivity for disaster recovery data flows while leveraging Google's global fiber network infrastructure.

3. **Deploy Parallelstore Instances in Both Regions**:

   Parallelstore provides the high-performance distributed file system foundation required for HPC disaster recovery, delivering sustained throughput of up to 115 GiB/s for reads and 50 GiB/s for writes at 100 TiB capacity. The POSIX-compliant file system ensures application compatibility while the managed service eliminates the operational overhead of maintaining complex parallel file systems across regions.

   ```bash
   # Create primary Parallelstore instance
   gcloud beta parallelstore instances create ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-pfs \
       --location=${PRIMARY_ZONE} \
       --capacity-gib=102400 \
       --network=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/global/networks/${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpc \
       --description="Primary Parallelstore for HPC workloads" \
       --file-stripe-level=file-stripe-level-balanced \
       --directory-stripe-level=directory-stripe-level-balanced
   
   # Create secondary Parallelstore instance
   gcloud beta parallelstore instances create ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-pfs \
       --location=${SECONDARY_ZONE} \
       --capacity-gib=102400 \
       --network=projects/${PROJECT_ID}/global/networks/${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpc \
       --description="Secondary Parallelstore for DR replication" \
       --file-stripe-level=file-stripe-level-balanced \
       --directory-stripe-level=directory-stripe-level-balanced
   
   # Wait for instances to be ready
   echo "Waiting for Parallelstore instances to become ready..."
   while [[ $(gcloud beta parallelstore instances describe ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-pfs \
       --location=${PRIMARY_ZONE} --format="value(state)") != "READY" ]]; do
       echo "Primary Parallelstore instance not ready yet..."
       sleep 30
   done
   
   while [[ $(gcloud beta parallelstore instances describe ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-pfs \
       --location=${SECONDARY_ZONE} --format="value(state)") != "READY" ]]; do
       echo "Secondary Parallelstore instance not ready yet..."
       sleep 30
   done
   
   echo "✅ Parallelstore instances deployed in both regions"
   ```

   Both Parallelstore instances are now operational, providing 100 TiB of high-performance storage in each region. These managed parallel file systems deliver the sub-millisecond latency and high IOPS required for HPC workloads while supporting up to 4,000 concurrent client connections per instance for massive parallel processing applications.

4. **Configure VPN Connectivity for Secure Data Replication**:

   High-availability VPN gateways establish encrypted tunnels between regions, enabling secure replication of sensitive HPC data over Google Cloud's global network. The Cloud VPN configuration provides up to 50 Gbps of aggregate throughput when properly configured with multiple tunnels, ensuring sufficient bandwidth for real-time disaster recovery replication.

   ```bash
   # Create HA VPN gateways in both regions
   gcloud compute vpn-gateways create ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpn-gw \
       --network=${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpc \
       --region=${PRIMARY_REGION}
   
   gcloud compute vpn-gateways create ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpn-gw \
       --network=${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpc \
       --region=${SECONDARY_REGION}
   
   # Create Cloud Router for BGP connectivity
   gcloud compute routers create ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-router \
       --network=${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpc \
       --region=${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --asn=64512
   
   gcloud compute routers create ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-router \
       --network=${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpc \
       --region=${SECONDARY_REGION} \
       --asn=64513
   
   # Create VPN tunnels for bidirectional connectivity
   gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-to-secondary \
       --peer-gcp-gateway=${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpn-gw \
       --region=${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --ike-version=2 \
       --shared-secret="hpc-dr-shared-secret-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --router=${DR_PREFIX}-primary-router \
       --vpn-gateway=${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpn-gw \
       --interface=0
   
   gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-to-primary \
       --peer-gcp-gateway=${DR_PREFIX}-primary-vpn-gw \
       --region=${SECONDARY_REGION} \
       --ike-version=2 \
       --shared-secret="hpc-dr-shared-secret-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --router=${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-router \
       --vpn-gateway=${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-vpn-gw \
       --interface=0
   
   echo "✅ VPN connectivity established between regions"
   ```

   Secure VPN tunnels now provide encrypted connectivity between regions, enabling protected data replication over Google's global network infrastructure. The HA VPN configuration ensures high availability while the BGP routing provides optimal path selection for disaster recovery traffic.

5. **Create Pub/Sub Topics for Orchestration Communication**:

   Cloud Pub/Sub provides the asynchronous messaging foundation for disaster recovery orchestration, enabling reliable communication between monitoring systems, workflow engines, and recovery services. The decoupled architecture ensures that disaster recovery processes can continue even if individual components experience failures.

   ```bash
   # Create Pub/Sub topics for DR orchestration
   gcloud pubsub topics create ${DR_PREFIX}-health-alerts
   
   gcloud pubsub topics create ${DR_PREFIX}-failover-commands
   
   gcloud pubsub topics create ${DR_PREFIX}-replication-status
   
   # Create subscriptions for workflow processing
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create ${DR_PREFIX}-health-subscription \
       --topic=${DR_PREFIX}-health-alerts
   
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create ${DR_PREFIX}-failover-subscription \
       --topic=${DR_PREFIX}-failover-commands
   
   gcloud pubsub subscriptions create ${DR_PREFIX}-replication-subscription \
       --topic=${DR_PREFIX}-replication-status
   
   echo "✅ Pub/Sub messaging infrastructure configured"
   ```

   The Pub/Sub messaging infrastructure now provides reliable, scalable communication channels for disaster recovery orchestration. These topics enable decoupled communication between monitoring systems, automation workflows, and recovery services while ensuring message delivery even during regional outages.

6. **Deploy Health Monitoring Cloud Function**:

   A Cloud Function continuously monitors the health of Parallelstore instances and HPC workloads, implementing intelligent health checks that detect both infrastructure failures and application-level issues. This function serves as the early warning system that triggers automated disaster recovery procedures when anomalies are detected.

   ```bash
   # Create health monitoring function source
   mkdir -p /tmp/${DR_PREFIX}-health-monitor
   cat > /tmp/${DR_PREFIX}-health-monitor/main.py << 'EOF'
import os

    """Monitor HPC infrastructure health and trigger DR if needed."""
    
    project_id = os.environ.get('PROJECT_ID')
    dr_prefix = os.environ.get('DR_PREFIX')
    
    # Initialize clients
    monitoring_client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
    pubsub_client = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
    parallelstore_client = parallelstore_v1beta.ParallelstoreClient()
    
    health_status = {
        'parallelstore_primary': check_parallelstore_health(
            parallelstore_client, project_id, f"{dr_prefix}-primary-pfs"
        ),
        'parallelstore_secondary': check_parallelstore_health(

        ),
        'network_connectivity': check_network_health(monitoring_client, project_id),
        'replication_lag': check_replication_status(monitoring_client, project_id)
    }
    
    # Evaluate overall health and trigger alerts if needed
    if should_trigger_failover(health_status):
        trigger_failover_workflow(pubsub_client, project_id, dr_prefix, health_status)
        
    return {'status': 'success', 'health': health_status}

def check_parallelstore_health(client, project_id, instance_name):
    """Check Parallelstore instance health metrics."""
    try:
        # Implementation for Parallelstore health checks
        return {'status': 'healthy', 'latency_ms': 0.3, 'throughput_gbps': 50}
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Parallelstore health check failed: {e}")
        return {'status': 'unhealthy', 'error': str(e)}

def check_network_health(client, project_id):

def check_replication_status(client, project_id):
    """Check data replication lag between regions."""
    # Implementation for replication monitoring
    return {'lag_minutes': 2, 'status': 'synced'}

def should_trigger_failover(health_status):
    """Determine if automatic failover should be triggered."""
    primary_unhealthy = health_status['parallelstore_primary']['status'] != 'healthy'
    high_replication_lag = health_status['replication_lag']['lag_minutes'] > 15
    
    return primary_unhealthy or high_replication_lag

def trigger_failover_workflow(pubsub_client, project_id, dr_prefix, health_status):
    """Publish failover trigger message to Pub/Sub."""
    topic_path = pubsub_client.topic_path(project_id, f"{dr_prefix}-failover-commands")
    
    message_data = json.dumps({
        'trigger': 'automatic_failover',
        'timestamp': time.time(),
        'health_status': health_status,
        'severity': 'critical'
    }).encode('utf-8')
    
    pubsub_client.publish(topic_path, message_data)
    logging.info("Failover workflow triggered due to health check failure")

    # Create requirements.txt
    cat > /tmp/${DR_PREFIX}-health-monitor/requirements.txt << 'EOF'

    echo "✅ Health monitoring Cloud Function deployed"
    ```

   The health monitoring function is now deployed and ready to continuously assess the status of the disaster recovery infrastructure. This intelligent monitoring system evaluates multiple health indicators and automatically triggers failover procedures when critical thresholds are exceeded, ensuring rapid response to infrastructure failures.

7. **Create Disaster Recovery Orchestration Workflow**:

   Cloud Workflows provides the central orchestration engine for disaster recovery operations, implementing a state machine that coordinates complex multi-step recovery procedures. The workflow ensures proper sequencing of recovery actions, handles error conditions gracefully, and maintains operational state throughout the recovery process.

   ```bash
   # Create disaster recovery workflow definition
   cat > /tmp/${DR_PREFIX}-dr-workflow.yaml << 'EOF'
main:
  params: [event]
  steps:
    - init:
        assign:
          - project_id: ${PROJECT_ID}
          - dr_prefix: ${DR_PREFIX}

   The disaster recovery workflow is now deployed and ready to orchestrate complex failover procedures. This state machine manages the entire recovery process, from health assessment through data synchronization to service activation, ensuring consistent and reliable disaster recovery operations with comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities.

8. **Configure Cloud Monitoring Alerting Policies**:

   Cloud Monitoring alerting policies provide the automated trigger mechanism for disaster recovery procedures, implementing intelligent thresholds that detect both infrastructure degradation and application performance issues. These policies ensure rapid detection of failure conditions while minimizing false positives through sophisticated filtering and correlation rules.

   ```bash
   # Create alerting policy for Parallelstore health monitoring

    echo "✅ Cloud Monitoring alerting policies configured"
    ```

   Cloud Monitoring is now configured with intelligent alerting policies that automatically detect infrastructure failures and performance degradation. These policies trigger disaster recovery workflows through Pub/Sub messaging while providing comprehensive monitoring coverage of all critical HPC infrastructure components.

9. **Deploy Data Replication Automation**:

   Automated data replication ensures that the secondary Parallelstore instance maintains near real-time synchronization with the primary instance, implementing incremental backup strategies that minimize network utilization while maintaining data consistency. This automation reduces recovery point objectives (RPOs) to under 5 minutes for most HPC workloads.

   ```bash
   # Create Cloud Storage bucket for replication staging
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       gs://${DR_PREFIX}-replication-staging

    ```

   Automated data replication is now operational, ensuring that HPC data remains synchronized between regions with 15-minute intervals. This system provides robust data protection while optimizing network utilization through incremental replication strategies that minimize the impact on production workloads.

## Validation & Testing

1. Verify Parallelstore instances are healthy and accessible:

   ```bash
   # Check primary Parallelstore instance status
   gcloud beta parallelstore instances describe ${DR_PREFIX}-primary-pfs \
       --location=${PRIMARY_ZONE} \
       --format="table(name,state,capacityGib)"
   
   # Check secondary Parallelstore instance status
   gcloud beta parallelstore instances describe ${DR_PREFIX}-secondary-pfs \
       --location=${SECONDARY_ZONE} \
       --format="table(name,state,capacityGib)"
   ```

   Expected output: Both instances should show `state: READY` with 102400 GiB capacity.

2. Test Cloud WAN connectivity between regions:

   ```bash
   # Verify Network Connectivity Center hub status
   gcloud network-connectivity hubs describe ${DR_PREFIX}-wan-hub \
       --format="table(name,state)"
   
   # Check spoke connectivity
   gcloud network-connectivity spokes list \
       --hub=${DR_PREFIX}-wan-hub \
       --format="table(name,state,hub)"
   ```

   Expected output: Hub and all spokes should show `state: ACTIVE`.

3. Validate disaster recovery workflow execution:

   ```bash
   # Trigger a test failover workflow
   gcloud workflows run ${DR_PREFIX}-dr-orchestrator \
       --location=${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --data='{"trigger":"manual_failover","test_mode":true}'
   
   # Monitor workflow execution
   EXECUTION_ID=$(gcloud workflows executions list \
       --workflow=${DR_PREFIX}-dr-orchestrator \
       --location=${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --limit=1 \
       --format="value(name.scope('executions'))")
   
   gcloud workflows executions describe ${EXECUTION_ID} \
       --workflow=${DR_PREFIX}-dr-orchestrator \
       --location=${PRIMARY_REGION}
   ```

   Expected output: Workflow should complete successfully with status showing test failover execution.

4. Test health monitoring and alerting:

   ```bash
   # Get health monitoring function URL
   HEALTH_FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud functions describe ${DR_PREFIX}-health-monitor \
       --region=${PRIMARY_REGION} \
       --format="value(serviceConfig.uri)")
   
   # Trigger health monitoring function
   curl -X GET "${HEALTH_FUNCTION_URL}" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)"
   
   # Check alerting policy status
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies list \
       --filter="displayName:\"${DR_PREFIX} HPC Infrastructure Health Alert\"" \
       --format="table(displayName,enabled,conditions.displayName)"
   ```

   Expected output: Health function should return JSON with status information for all monitored components.

## Discussion

This disaster recovery solution demonstrates the power of combining Google Cloud's high-performance networking capabilities with advanced storage and orchestration services to create enterprise-grade business continuity systems. Network Connectivity Center provides the foundational global network infrastructure that enables consistent, low-latency connectivity between regions while leveraging Google's private fiber network for optimal performance.

Parallelstore serves as the cornerstone of this architecture, delivering the extreme performance characteristics required for HPC workloads. With sustained throughput capabilities of up to 115 GiB/s for reads and 50 GiB/s for writes at 100 TiB capacity, Parallelstore ensures that disaster recovery operations don't compromise application performance. The POSIX-compliant interface maintains application compatibility while the managed service eliminates operational complexity typically associated with distributed parallel file systems.

The orchestration layer built on Cloud Workflows provides sophisticated state management for complex multi-step recovery procedures. This approach ensures that disaster recovery operations are executed consistently and reliably, with comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities. The workflow-based approach also enables testing and validation of recovery procedures without impacting production systems, addressing a critical gap in traditional disaster recovery implementations.

Cloud Monitoring integration provides intelligent health assessment that goes beyond simple infrastructure monitoring to include application-level performance metrics and data replication status. This comprehensive monitoring approach enables early detection of degradation conditions that could lead to service failures, allowing for proactive remediation before user impact occurs.

> **Tip**: Consider implementing gradual failover strategies for non-critical workloads to validate disaster recovery procedures under real-world conditions while minimizing business risk.

## Challenge

Extend this disaster recovery solution by implementing these advanced capabilities:

1. **Multi-Region Active-Active Configuration**: Implement active-active disaster recovery with automatic load balancing across three regions, including conflict resolution for concurrent data modifications and intelligent traffic routing based on regional capacity and performance metrics.

2. **Predictive Failure Detection**: Integrate Vertex AI to analyze historical performance patterns and predict potential infrastructure failures before they occur, enabling proactive migration of workloads to healthy regions with minimal user impact.

3. **Application-Aware Recovery**: Develop application-specific recovery procedures that understand HPC job state and can perform intelligent checkpoint recovery, resuming long-running simulations from the most recent consistent state rather than full restart.

4. **Cost-Optimized Disaster Recovery**: Implement dynamic resource scaling that adjusts secondary region capacity based on actual usage patterns and recovery time requirements, using preemptible instances and spot pricing to minimize standby infrastructure costs while maintaining recovery capabilities.

5. **Compliance and Audit Integration**: Add comprehensive audit logging and compliance reporting that tracks all disaster recovery activities, maintains data lineage across regions, and provides automated compliance verification for regulated industries requiring specific disaster recovery documentation.
