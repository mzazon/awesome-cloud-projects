   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Create staging bucket for pipeline artifacts
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}-staging
   
   # Enable versioning for data protection
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}-staging
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Storage buckets created successfully"
   ```

   The storage infrastructure now provides reliable, scalable data hosting with versioning enabled for data lineage and recovery. This foundation supports both the interactive development workflow in Colab Enterprise and the production data processing requirements of Cloud Data Fusion with automatic redundancy and global accessibility.

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset for analytics
   bq mk \
       --project_id=${PROJECT_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --dataset \
       ${DATASET_NAME}
   
   # Set dataset description and labels
   bq update \
       --description "Analytics dataset for pipeline prototyping" \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery dataset created: ${DATASET_NAME}"
   ```

   The BigQuery dataset provides a serverless, highly scalable analytics platform that automatically optimizes query performance. This integration enables real-time validation of transformation results and supports advanced analytics workflows directly from Colab Enterprise notebooks with built-in machine learning capabilities.

   gcloud beta data-fusion instances create ${INSTANCE_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --edition=developer \
       --enable-stackdriver-logging \
       --enable-stackdriver-monitoring
   
   # Wait for instance to become ready (this may take 15-20 minutes)
   echo "⏳ Waiting for Data Fusion instance to become ready..."
   gcloud beta data-fusion instances wait ${INSTANCE_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --condition=ready
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Data Fusion instance deployed successfully"
   ```

   The Cloud Data Fusion instance now provides a fully managed, visual pipeline development environment with built-in data quality validation, monitoring, and scaling capabilities. This platform enables seamless transition from notebook prototypes to production-ready data pipelines with enterprise security and governance features.

4. **Create Sample Data for Pipeline Development**:

   # Clear environment variables
   unset PROJECT_ID REGION ZONE RANDOM_SUFFIX
   unset INSTANCE_NAME BUCKET_NAME DATASET_NAME
   
   echo "✅ Local files and environment variables cleaned up"
   echo "Note: Data Fusion instance deletion may take additional time to complete"
   ```

## Discussion

This solution demonstrates the power of combining interactive notebook development with enterprise-grade pipeline orchestration for accelerated data pipeline development and deployment. Colab Enterprise provides data scientists with a familiar, collaborative environment for exploring data transformations and validating business logic, while Cloud Data Fusion offers the scalability, reliability, and governance required for production data processing. The integration between these services enables a seamless workflow from experimentation to production deployment, significantly reducing development cycles and improving deployment reliability.

The architectural pattern follows Google Cloud's recommended approach for modern data platform development, emphasizing separation of concerns between data exploration, transformation logic development, and production pipeline orchestration. By leveraging BigQuery as the serverless analytics engine and Cloud Storage as the scalable data lake foundation, organizations can build comprehensive data platforms that support both ad-hoc analysis and scheduled data processing workflows. This approach reduces traditional friction between data science teams and data engineering teams by providing shared tools, consistent deployment patterns, and unified data access patterns.

The interactive development workflow significantly accelerates pipeline development cycles by enabling immediate feedback on transformation logic, data quality validation, and performance characteristics. Data scientists can iterate rapidly on complex transformations using familiar Python libraries and pandas operations, then translate successful patterns into production pipeline configurations with built-in data quality checks and monitoring. This approach reduces development time by 60-80% compared to traditional pipeline development approaches and improves production deployment reliability by thoroughly validating transformation logic before scaling to large datasets.

> **Tip**: Use Colab Enterprise's integration with Vertex AI for advanced ML model development alongside your data pipeline prototyping. This enables end-to-end ML workflows from data preparation through model deployment, all within the same collaborative environment with enterprise security and governance.

The monitoring and observability capabilities provided by Cloud Data Fusion, combined with Google Cloud's operations suite, enable comprehensive visibility into pipeline performance, data quality metrics, and system health. Organizations can implement sophisticated alerting patterns and automated remediation workflows to ensure reliable data delivery for downstream analytics and machine learning applications.
