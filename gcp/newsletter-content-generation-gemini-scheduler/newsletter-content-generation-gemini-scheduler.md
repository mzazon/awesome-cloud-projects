# Newsletter Content Generation with Gemini and Scheduler

## Problem

Marketing teams spend hours each week creating personalized newsletter content, manually crafting subject lines, articles, and calls-to-action for different audience segments. This time-intensive process limits campaign frequency, reduces content personalization, and prevents teams from focusing on strategy and analysis. Traditional content management systems lack AI-powered automation and struggle to maintain consistent brand voice across multiple campaigns.

## Solution

Implement an automated newsletter content generation system using Gemini AI for intelligent content creation, Cloud Functions for serverless processing, and Cloud Scheduler for automated execution. This serverless architecture generates personalized newsletter content on a predefined schedule, stores results in Cloud Storage, and scales automatically based on demand while maintaining cost efficiency through pay-per-use pricing.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for GCP resources
export PROJECT_ID="newsletter-gen-$(date +%s)"
export REGION="us-central1"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set default project and region
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud config set compute/region ${REGION}
gcloud config set compute/zone ${ZONE}

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudscheduler.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com

echo "✅ Project configured: ${PROJECT_ID}"

# Create environment variables for resources
export FUNCTION_NAME="newsletter-generator-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BUCKET_NAME="newsletter-content-${PROJECT_ID}-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export JOB_NAME="newsletter-schedule-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export TOPIC_NAME="newsletter-trigger-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket for Content Storage**:

   Cloud Storage provides scalable object storage with global accessibility and integrated security features. This bucket will store both input templates and generated newsletter content, enabling easy access for marketing teams and integration with content management systems.

   ```bash
   # Create bucket with standard storage class
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Enable versioning for content history
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ Storage bucket created: gs://${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket now provides versioned object storage with regional redundancy, ensuring content durability and accessibility for the newsletter generation system.

2. **Create Content Template Files**:

   Templates provide structured guidance for Gemini AI, ensuring consistent brand voice and content format across all generated newsletters. These JSON templates define content sections, tone guidelines, and variable placeholders for personalization.

   ```bash
   # Create local template directory
   mkdir -p newsletter-function
   cd newsletter-function
   
   # Create content template file
   cat > content-template.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "newsletter_template": {
       "subject_line": "Generate an engaging subject line about {topic}",
       "intro": "Write a brief introduction paragraph about {topic} in a professional yet friendly tone",
       "main_content": "Create 2-3 paragraphs of informative content about {topic}, including practical tips or insights",
       "call_to_action": "Write a compelling call-to-action related to {topic}",
       "tone": "professional, engaging, informative",
       "target_audience": "business professionals and marketing teams",
       "word_limit": 300
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Content template created"
   ```

   The template structure ensures consistent newsletter format while allowing dynamic content generation based on specified topics and audience preferences.

3. **Deploy Cloud Function for Content Generation**:

   Cloud Functions provides serverless execution for the newsletter generation logic, automatically scaling based on demand while integrating seamlessly with Gemini AI. This function processes template data, calls the Gemini API, and stores generated content.

   ```bash
   # Create function source code
   cat > main.py << 'EOF'
   import json
   import os
   from datetime import datetime
   from google.cloud import storage
   import vertexai
   from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel
   import functions_framework
   
   def initialize_services():
       """Initialize Google Cloud services"""
       project_id = os.environ.get('GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT')
       bucket_name = os.environ.get('BUCKET_NAME')
       
       # Initialize Vertex AI
       vertexai.init(project=project_id, location="us-central1")
       
       # Initialize storage client
       storage_client = storage.Client()
       bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
       
       return bucket, project_id
   
   def generate_newsletter_content(topic, template):
       """Generate newsletter content using Gemini"""
       model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")
       
       prompt = f"""
       Create newsletter content based on this template and topic:

       """
       
       response = model.generate_content(prompt)
       return response.text
   
   @functions_framework.http
   def generate_newsletter(request):
       """HTTP Cloud Function to generate newsletter content"""
       try:
           # Initialize services
           bucket, project_id = initialize_services()
           
           # Get request data
           request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
           topic = request_json.get('topic', 'Digital Marketing Trends') if request_json else 'Digital Marketing Trends'
           
           # Load template (in production, load from Cloud Storage)
           template = {
               "subject_line": "Generate an engaging subject line about {topic}",
               "intro": "Write a brief introduction paragraph about {topic} in a professional yet friendly tone",
               "main_content": "Create 2-3 paragraphs of informative content about {topic}, including practical tips or insights",

               "word_limit": 300
           }
           
           # Generate content
           generated_content = generate_newsletter_content(topic, template)
           
           # Create timestamp for filename
           timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
           filename = f"newsletter_{topic.replace(' ', '_').lower()}_{timestamp}.json"
           
           # Store result in Cloud Storage
           blob = bucket.blob(f"generated-content/{filename}")
           result_data = {
               "topic": topic,
               "generated_at": timestamp,
               "content": generated_content,
               "template_used": template
           }
           blob.upload_from_string(json.dumps(result_data, indent=2))
           
           return {
               "status": "success",
               "message": f"Newsletter content generated for topic: {topic}",
               "filename": filename,
               "storage_path": f"gs://{bucket.name}/generated-content/{filename}"
           }, 200
           
       except Exception as e:
           return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}, 500
   EOF
   
   # Create requirements.txt with updated package versions
   cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
   google-cloud-storage==2.18.0
   google-cloud-aiplatform==1.102.0
   functions-framework==3.8.1
   vertexai==1.92.0
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Function code created"
   ```

   The Cloud Function now contains comprehensive logic for content generation, error handling, and storage integration, providing a robust serverless solution for newsletter automation.

4. **Deploy the Cloud Function**:

   Deploying the function creates a managed, scalable endpoint that integrates with Google Cloud's security and monitoring systems. The deployment process builds the function, installs dependencies, and configures runtime environment variables.

   ```bash
   # Deploy function with environment variables and latest Python runtime
   gcloud functions deploy ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --runtime python312 \
       --trigger-http \
       --source . \
       --entry-point generate_newsletter \
       --memory 512MB \
       --timeout 300s \
       --set-env-vars BUCKET_NAME=${BUCKET_NAME} \
       --allow-unauthenticated
   
   # Get function URL for scheduling
   FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud functions describe ${FUNCTION_NAME} \
       --format="value(httpsTrigger.url)")
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Function deployed successfully"
   echo "Function URL: ${FUNCTION_URL}"
   ```

   The Cloud Function is now live with HTTP trigger capabilities, environment variable configuration, and appropriate memory allocation for AI processing workloads using the latest Python 3.12 runtime.

5. **Create Cloud Scheduler Job for Automation**:

   Cloud Scheduler provides fully managed cron job functionality with built-in retry logic and failure handling. This scheduled job will trigger newsletter generation automatically, ensuring consistent content creation without manual intervention.

   ```bash
   # Create scheduler job for weekly newsletter generation
   gcloud scheduler jobs create http ${JOB_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --schedule="0 9 * * 1" \
       --uri=${FUNCTION_URL} \
       --http-method=POST \
       --headers="Content-Type=application/json" \
       --message-body='{"topic":"Weekly Marketing Insights"}' \
       --description="Weekly newsletter content generation"
   
   echo "✅ Scheduler job created: ${JOB_NAME}"
   echo "Schedule: Every Monday at 9:00 AM"
   ```

   The scheduler is now configured to automatically trigger newsletter generation every Monday morning, providing consistent content delivery for marketing campaigns.

6. **Test the Complete System**:

   Testing validates the entire workflow from trigger to content generation, ensuring proper integration between all components and verifying content quality and storage functionality.

   ```bash
   # Manually trigger the scheduler job for testing
   gcloud scheduler jobs run ${JOB_NAME} --location=${REGION}
   
   echo "✅ Test execution triggered"
   echo "Check Cloud Functions logs for execution details"
   
   # Wait a moment for processing
   sleep 10
   
   # List generated content
   gsutil ls gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/generated-content/
   
   echo "✅ System test completed"
   ```

   The system test confirms end-to-end functionality, from scheduled execution through content generation to storage, validating the complete newsletter automation workflow.
