# Example Terraform variables for Location-Aware Content Generation
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values for your deployment

# Required Variables
# ===================

# Google Cloud Project ID where resources will be created
# Replace with your actual project ID
project_id = "my-location-content-project"

# Google Cloud region for deploying resources
# Recommended: us-central1 for Vertex AI compatibility
region = "us-central1"

# Google Cloud zone for zonal resources
zone = "us-central1-a"

# Optional Customization Variables
# =================================

# Prefix for Cloud Storage bucket names (will be made globally unique)
bucket_name_prefix = "location-content"

# Name of the Cloud Function
function_name = "generate-location-content"

# Memory allocation for the Cloud Function
# Options: 128Mi, 256Mi, 512Mi, 1Gi, 2Gi, 4Gi, 8Gi
function_memory = "512Mi"

# Timeout for the Cloud Function in seconds (1-540)
function_timeout = 60

# Maximum number of function instances (1-1000)
function_max_instances = 10

# Minimum number of function instances (0 for scale-to-zero)
function_min_instances = 0

# Service account name for the Cloud Function
service_account_name = "location-content-sa"

# Storage Configuration
# =====================

# Enable versioning on the content storage bucket
enable_versioning = true

# Enable uniform bucket-level access (recommended for security)
enable_uniform_bucket_level_access = true

# Delete objects older than this many days (0 to disable)
bucket_lifecycle_age_days = 365

# Security Configuration
# ======================

# Allow unauthenticated access to the Cloud Function
# Set to false for production environments
allow_unauthenticated = true

# CORS allowed origins for the Cloud Function
# Use ["*"] for all origins or specify specific domains
cors_origins = ["*"]

# Resource Labels
# ===============

# Labels to apply to all resources for organization and billing
labels = {
  project     = "location-content-generation"
  component   = "content-api"
  environment = "demo"
  managed-by  = "terraform"
  team        = "ai-development"
  cost-center = "research"
}

# Advanced Configuration
# ======================

# Directory containing the Cloud Function source code
# Leave as default unless you've moved the function source
function_source_dir = "../function-source"

# Example Production Configuration
# ================================
# Uncomment and modify these values for production deployment:

# project_id = "production-location-content"
# region = "us-central1"
# function_memory = "1Gi"
# function_timeout = 120
# function_max_instances = 100
# function_min_instances = 1
# allow_unauthenticated = false
# bucket_lifecycle_age_days = 90
# 
# labels = {
#   project     = "location-content-generation"
#   component   = "content-api"
#   environment = "production"
#   managed-by  = "terraform"
#   team        = "content-platform"
#   cost-center = "marketing"
# }

# Development Configuration Example
# =================================
# Uncomment and modify these values for development environment:

# project_id = "dev-location-content"
# region = "us-central1"
# function_memory = "256Mi"
# function_timeout = 30
# function_max_instances = 5
# function_min_instances = 0
# allow_unauthenticated = true
# bucket_lifecycle_age_days = 30
# 
# labels = {
#   project     = "location-content-generation"
#   component   = "content-api" 
#   environment = "development"
#   managed-by  = "terraform"
#   team        = "ai-development"
#   cost-center = "research"
# }
