# Smart Product Review Analysis with Translation and Natural Language AI

## Problem

Global e-commerce businesses receive customer product reviews in dozens of languages, making it impossible to understand customer sentiment and extract actionable insights at scale. Manual translation and analysis is time-consuming, expensive, and doesn't scale with business growth. Without unified analysis capabilities, businesses lose valuable customer feedback that could improve products, marketing, and customer satisfaction across different markets and regions.

## Solution

Create an automated pipeline using Google Cloud Translation API to standardize reviews into English, then apply Natural Language AI for sentiment analysis and entity extraction. Cloud Functions orchestrates the processing workflow while BigQuery stores and enables analytics on the enriched review data. This serverless approach scales automatically with review volume and provides real-time insights across all global markets.

               'sentiment_magnitude': sentiment.magnitude,
               'sentiment_label': sentiment_label,
               'entities': json.dumps(entities),
               'processing_timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
           }
           
           # Insert into BigQuery
           dataset_id = request_json.get('dataset_id', 'product_reviews')
           table_id = 'review_analysis'
           
           table_ref = bigquery_client.dataset(dataset_id).table(table_id)
           table = bigquery_client.get_table(table_ref)
           
           errors = bigquery_client.insert_rows_json(table, [analysis_result])
           
           if errors:
               logging.error(f"BigQuery insert errors: {errors}")
               return {'error': 'Failed to insert data into BigQuery'}, 500
           
           logging.info(f"Successfully processed review {review_id}")
           
           return {
               'status': 'success',
               'review_id': review_id,
               'original_language': source_language,
               'sentiment_label': sentiment_label,
               'sentiment_score': sentiment.score,
               'entities_count': len(entities)
           }
           
       except Exception as e:
           logging.error(f"Error processing review: {str(e)}")
